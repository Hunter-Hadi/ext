<h1 contenteditable='true'>The Adventures of Little Red Riding Hood</h1>
<h2 contenteditable='true'>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
<p contenteditable='true'>Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a little girl named Little Red Riding Hood. She loved to play in the woods near her home, and she always wore a red hooded cloak that her grandmother had made for her.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2: The Wolf in the Woods</h2>
<p>One day, Little Red Riding Hood was on her way to visit her grandmother. She had a basket of goodies in her hand and a skip in her step. As she walked through the woods, she met a big, bad wolf.</p>
<p>"Hello, Little Red Riding Hood," said the wolf. "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to visit my grandmother," said Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
<p>"And what's in your basket?" asked the wolf.</p>
<p>"Just some goodies for my grandmother," said Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
<p>The wolf licked his lips. "Well, I'm sure your grandmother will love those goodies. Why don't you let me help you carry the basket?"</p>
<p>Little Red Riding Hood didn't know what to do. She had been taught to be polite to everyone, but something about the wolf made her uneasy. "No, thank you," she said. "I can carry it myself."</p>
<p>But the wolf was persistent. "Are you sure? It looks heavy. Let me help you."</p>
<p>Little Red Riding Hood hesitated for a moment, but then she remembered what her mother had told her. "No, thank you," she said again. "I can manage."</p>
<p>The wolf shrugged and walked away. Little Red Riding Hood breathed a sigh of relief and continued on her way.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3: The Rescue</h2>
<p>Just as Little Red Riding Hood was about to knock on her grandmother's door, the wolf appeared again. This time, he was angry that Little Red Riding Hood had gotten away from him earlier.</p>
<p>"Now, little girl," said the wolf, "you're going to come with me."</p>
<p>Little Red Riding Hood was scared. She knew that the wolf was dangerous, and she didn't know what to do. But just then, a woodsman appeared. He had heard the commotion and came to see what was going on. When he saw the wolf, he knew what had to be done.</p>
<p>With one swift blow of his axe, the woodsman killed the wolf and rescued Little Red Riding Hood. She was shaken but
  unharmed.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4: The End</h2>
<p>Little Red Riding Hood thanked the woodsman for saving her life. Then she went inside to see her grandmother. She told her grandmother what had happened, and they both agreed that they would never go into the woods alone again.</p>
