To do so, it needs to have a detailed accounting of it carbon footprint and take appropriate action to reverse it.\n\n*   **Clothing brands with sustainability certifications**. Sustainability certifications are a signal to customers that they’re not being duped by greenwashing. Most of the reputable certifications are managed by bodies that have third-party oversight of brands that hold them. And some, like B Corp, Fair Trade, and 1% for the Planet are widely recognized by the public as a symbol of authenticity.\n\n*   **Fashion brands committed to safe production processes.** There is a human cost to dirty and unethical production practices. Some corporations have used loopholes to bypass environmental and disposal laws to manufacture more cheaply. This has resulted in numerous examples of contaminating the water supply of entire communities, or harming wildlife habitats. \n\n### Reduce, reuse, recycle\n\n*   **Clothing exchange and recycling programs.** Fashion brands that are truly end-to-end sustainable are thinking beyond the wearable life of their products. Some offer items that can biodegrade and others, like these brands, incentivize the return of worn items so they can be [resold](/blog/resale), reused, or recycled into new items.\n*   **Clothing rental brands.** Another sustainable practice is helping to eliminate overproduction. Buying a dress for a single occasion is wasteful, and high-end pieces often are price-inaccessible. Fashion rental brands have popped up in Rent The Runway’s wake, renting the same dress to multiple consumers.\n*   **Sustainable fashion brands that use recycled materials.** Much innovation has been poured into the problem of waste. As an island of plastic swells in the Pacific Ocean, we can no longer ignore the impacts of making more. Now, recycled plastic bottles and used fishing nets are being spun into new fabrics, diverting the original product from the landfill and into something usable again.\n*   **Fashion brands built for a lifetime of wear.** Fast fashion’s biggest failure is arguably how disposable its output is. Made cheaply, these pieces deteriorate quickly and necessitate more buying. One solution to this is producing (and buying) clothing meant to last—the upfront cost is higher, but is comparable to buying multiple fast fashion versions over time. \n*   **Vintage and secondhand clothing brands.** Similar to upcycled clothing brands, vintage businesses take the old and make it new again. Vintage clothing is inherently sustainable because it requires no new resources and doesn’t contribute to the production waste or impact typical of new clothing manufacturers.\n\n![A person holds a green sneaker in front of a green background](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/green-shoes.jpg?v=1683930581)\n\n### Sustainable materials\n\n*   **Upcycled apparel brands.** What’s even better than producing sustainable fabrics? Using materials that already exist and otherwise may have gone to the landfill. These clever brands have reworked pieces that normally would be considered garbage to create something new. \n\n*   **Leather alternative and cruelty-free clothing brands.** Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the chemical-laden process of curing and tanning leather uses a massive amount of energy, water, and resources. Consumers have been delivered a confusing amount of information, with leather proponents arguing that plastic-based alternatives are equally damaging. Much R&D in the past few years, however, has revealed a happy medium: “leather” made from plants. [Bolt Threads](https://boltthreads.com/technology/mylo/) was an early innovator in mushroom leather, partnering with brands like Stella McCartney.\n\n*   **Clothing brands that use organic materials.** Along with commitments to ethical labor, these brands are making a positive impact by using cotton that has been produced without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers—both of which can contaminate water sources and do harm to the people and wildlife that depend on them. \n\n### Social responsibility\n\n*   **Brands that give back.** Despite best efforts, most companies will contribute to some amount of negative impact on the planet, whether directly through material consumption or indirectly through shipping emissions. Offsetting is a way brands can own up to their impact. Many do so through contributing to [carbon removal projects](/blog/carbon-offsets) or giving back.\n\n*   **Ethical clothing brands.** These sustainable brands have a commitment to ethics all the way down the supply chain. They care about fair wages, local production, ethical sourcing of raw materials, and safe working conditions.\n\nSustainability at every stage of the supply chain\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n![A woman with bangs sniffs a pink flower](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/eco-fashion-model.jpg?v=1683930679)When you’re building a clothing brand, sustainable and ethical practices should be baked into your mission and business practices from the get-go. It’s no longer an option—it’s what customers demand. \n\nEstablished businesses can find inspiration from this list to make impactful changes, whether it’s sourcing better materials, giving back, or improving working conditions. Even small steps in the right direction can lighten your footprint—and meet customers where they are.\n```"
