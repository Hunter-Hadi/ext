Chapter 1
The Divine Root Conceives and the Spring Breaks Forth
As the Heart's Nature Is Cultivated, the Great Way Arises
Before Chaos was divided, Heaven and Earth were one;
All was a shapeless blur, and no men had appeared.
Once Pan Gu destroyed the Enormous Vagueness
The separation of clear and impure began.
Living things have always tended towards humanity;
From their creation all beings improve.
If you want to know about Creation and Time,
Read Difficulties Resolved on the Journey to the West.
In the arithmetic of the universe, 129,600 years make one cycle. Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases:
I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the twelve branches. Each phase lasts 10,800 years.
Now within a single day, the positive begins at the time I; at II the cock crows; at III it is not quite light; at IV
the sun rises; V is after breakfast; and at VI one does business. VII is when the sun reaches noon; at VIII it is
slipping towards the West; IX is late afternoon; the sun sets at X; XI is dusk; and at XII people settle down for
the night.
If you compare this with the big numbers, then at the end of Phase XI Heaven and Earth were still one, and no
beings had appeared. 5,400 years later came the beginning of Phase XII, when all was darkness and there
were still no people or other creatures; for this reason it was called Chaos. Another 5,400 years later Phase XII
was drawing to a close and a new cycle was about to begin. As Phase I of the new era approached, gradually
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 3
there was light. As Shao Yong said,
"When winter reaches the mid−point of Phase I
The heart of Heaven does not move.
Where the Positive first appears
Nothing has yet come to life."
At this time, Heaven first had a foundation. 5,400 years later, in the middle of Phase I, the light and pure rose
upwards, and sun, moon, stars, and constellations were created. These were called the Four Images. Hence the
saying that heaven began in I.
Another 5,400 years later, when Phase I was nearing its end and Phase II was imminent, things gradually
solidified. As the Book of Changes says, "Great is the Positive; far−reaching is the Negative! All things are
endowed and born in accordance with Heaven." This was when the earth began to congeal. After 5,400 more
years came the height of Phase II, when the heavy and impure solidified, and water, fire, mountains, stone,
and Earth came into being. These five were called the Five Movers. Therefore it is said that the Earth was
created in Phase II.
After a further 5,400 years, at the end of Phase II and the beginning of the Phase III, living beings were
created. In the words of the Book of the Calendar, "The essence of the sky came down and the essence of
earth went up. Heaven and Earth intermingled, and all creatures were born." Then Heaven was bright and
Earth was fresh, and the Positive intermingled with the Negative. 5,400 years later, when Phase III was at its
height, men, birds and beasts were created. Thus the Three Powers−−Heaven, Earth and Man−−now had their
set places. Therefore it is said that man was created in Phase III.
Moved by Pan Gu's creation, the Three Emperors put the world in order and the Five Rulers laid down the
moral code. The world was then divided into four great continents: The Eastern Continent of Superior Body,
the Western Continent of Cattle−gift, the Southern Continent of Jambu and the Northern Continent of Kuru.
This book deals only with the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. Beyond the seas there is a country called
Aolai. This country is next to an ocean, and in the middle of the ocean is a famous island called the Mountain
of Flowers and Fruit. This mountain is the ancestral artery of the Ten Continents, the origin of the Three
Islands; it was formed when the clear and impure were separated and the Enormous Vagueness was divided. It
is a really splendid mountain and there are some verses to prove it:
It stills the ocean with its might,
It awes the jade sea into calm.
It stills the ocean with its might:
Tides wash its silver slopes and fish swim into its caves.
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 4
It awes the jade sea into calm:
Amid the snowy breakers the sea−serpent rises from the deep.
It rises high in the corner of the world where Fire and Wood meet;
Its summit towers above the Eastern Sea.
Red cliffs and strange rocks;
Beetling crags and jagged peaks.
On the red cliffs phoenixes sing in pairs;
Lone unicorns lie before the beetling crags.
The cry of pheasants is heard upon the peaks;
In caves the dragons come and go.
There are deer of long life and magic foxes in the woods;
Miraculous birds and black cranes in the trees.
There are flowers of jade and strange plants that wither not;
Green pine and bluish cypress ever in leaf,
Magic peaches always in fruit.
Clouds gather round the tall bamboo.
The wisteria grows thick around the mountain brook
And the banks around are newly−coloured with flowers.
It is the Heaven−supporting pillar where all the rivers meet,
The Earth's root, unchanged through a myriad aeons.
There was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirty−six feet five inches high and
twenty−four feet round. It was thirty−six feet five inches high to correspond with the 365 degrees of the
heavens, and twenty−four feet round to match the twenty−four divisions of the solar calendar. On top of it
were nine apertures and eight holes, for the Nine Palaces and the Eight Trigrams. There were no trees around
it to give shade, but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sides. Ever since Creation began it had been
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 5
receiving the truth of Heaven, the beauty of Earth, the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon; and
as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powers. It developed a magic womb, which
burst open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ball.
When the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey, complete with the five senses and four limbs.
When the stone monkey had learned to crawl and walk, he bowed to each of the four quarters. As his eyes
moved, two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace and startled the Supreme Heavenly Sage,
the Greatly Compassionate Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven, who was sitting surrounded by his
immortal ministers on his throne in the Hall of Miraculous Mist in the Golden−gated Cloud Palace. When he
saw the dazzling golden light he ordered Thousand−mile Eye and Wind−accompanying Ear to open the
Southern Gate of Heaven and take a look. The two officers went out through the gate in obedience to the
imperial command, and while one observed what was going on the other listened carefully. Soon afterwards
they reported back:
"In obedience to the Imperial Mandate your subjects observed and listened to the source of the golden light.
We found that at the edge of the country of Aolai, which is East of the ocean belonging to the Eastern
Continent of Superior Body, there is an island called the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. A magic stone on the
top of this mountain produced a magic egg, and when the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey
which bowed to each of the four quarters. When he moved his eyes, golden light shot towards the Pole Star
Palace; but now that he is eating and drinking, the golden light is gradually dying."
In his benevolence and mercy the Jade Emperor said, "Creatures down below are born of the essence of
heaven and earth: there is nothing remarkable about him."
On his mountain the monkey was soon able to run and jump, feed from plants and trees, drink from brooks
and springs, pick mountain flowers and look for fruit. He made friends with the wolves, went around with the
tigers and leopards, was on good terms with the deer, and had the other monkeys and apes for relations. At
night he slept under the rockfaces, and he roamed around the peaks and caves by day. As the saying so rightly
goes, "There is no calendar in the mountains, and when winter's over you don't know the time of year." On hot
mornings he and all the other monkeys would play under the shade of some pines to avoid the heat. Just look
at them all:
Climbing trees, picking flowers, looking for fruit;
Throwing pellets, playing knucklebones;
Running round sandy hollows, building stone pagodas;
Chasing dragonflies and catching locusts;
Worshipping the sky and visiting Bodhisattvas;
Tearing off creepers and weaving straw hats;
Catching fleas then popping them with their teeth and fingers;
Grooming their coats and sharpening their nails;
Beating, scratching, pushing, squashing, tearing and tugging;
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 6
Playing all over the place under the pine trees;
Washing themselves beside the green stream.
After playing, the monkeys would go and bathe in the stream, a mountain torrent that tumbled along like
rolling melons. There is an old saying, "Birds have bird language and, animals have animal talk."
All the monkeys said to each other, "I wonder where that water comes from. We've got nothing else to do
today, so wouldn't it be fun to go upstream and find its source?" With a shout they all ran off, leading their
children and calling to their brothers. They climbed up the mountain beside the stream until they reached its
source, where a waterfall cascaded from a spring. They saw
One white rainbow arching,
A thousand strands of flying snow,
Unbroken by the sea winds,
Still there under the moon.
Cold air divides the greeny crags,
Splashes moisten the mountainside;
A noble waterfall cascades,
Hanging suspended like a curtain.
The monkeys clapped their hands and explained with delight, "What lovely water. It must go all the way to
the bottom of the mountain and join the waves of the sea."
Then one monkey made a suggestion: "If anyone is clever enough to go through the fall, find the source, and
come out in one piece, let's make him our king." When this challenge had been shouted three times, the stone
monkey leapt out from the crowd and answered at the top of his voice, "I'll go, I'll go." Splendid monkey!
Indeed:
Today he will make his name;
Tomorrow his destiny shall triumph.
He is fated to live here;
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 7
As a King he will enter the Immortals' palace.
Watch him as he shuts his eyes, crouches, and springs, leaping straight into the waterfall. When he opened his
eyes and raised his head to look round, he saw neither water nor waves. A bridge stood in front of him, as
large as life. He stopped, calmed himself, took a closer look, and saw that the bridge was made of iron. The
water that rushed under it poured out through a fissure in the rocks, screening the gateway to the bridge. He
started walking towards the bridge, and as he looked he made out what seemed to be a house. It was a really
good place. He saw:
Emerald moss piled up in heaps of blue,
White clouds like drifting jade,
While the light flickered among wisps of coloured mist.
A quiet house with peaceful windows,
Flowers growing on the smooth bench;
Dragon pearls hanging in niches,
Exotic blooms all around.
Traces of fire beside the stove,
Scraps of food in the vessels by the table.
Adorable stone chairs and beds,
Even better stone plates and bowls.
One or two tall bamboos,
Three or four sprigs of plum blossom,
A few pines that always attract rain,
All just like a real home.
He took a good, long look and then scampered to the middle of the bridge, from where he noticed a stone
tablet. On the tablet had been carved in big square letters: HAPPY LAND OF THE MOUNTAIN OF
FLOWERS AND FRUIT, CAVE HEAVEN OF THE WATER CURTAIN. The stone monkey was beside
himself with glee. He rushed away, shut his eyes, crouched, and leapt back through the waterfall.
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 8
"We're in luck, we're in luck," he said with a chuckle. All the other monkeys crowded round him asking,
"What's it like in there? How deep is the water?"
"There's no water, none at all," replied the stone monkey. "There's an iron bridge, and on the other side of the
bridge there's a house that must have been made by Heaven and Earth."
"How ever could you see a house there?" the other monkeys asked. The stone monkey chuckled again.
"The water here comes under the bridge and through the rocks, and it hides the gateway to the bridge from
view. There are flowers and trees by the bridge, and a stone house too. Inside the house are stone rooms, a
stone stove, stone bowls, stone plates, stone beds, and even stone benches. In the middle of it all is a tablet
which says 'Happy Land of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, Cave Heaven of the Water Curtain'. It's just
the place for us to settle down in−−there's room there for thousands. Let's all move in, then we won't have to
put up with any more nonsense from heaven. In there
We can hide there from the wind,
And shelter from the rain,
With nothing to fear from frost and snow,
And never a rumble of thunder.
The coloured mists glow bright
And the place smells lucky.
The pine and bamboo will always be beautiful,
And rare flowers blossom every day."
The other monkeys were all so delighted to hear this that they said, "You go first and take us with you."
The stone monkey shut his eyes, crouched, and leapt in again, shouting, "Follow me in, follow me in." The
braver monkeys all jumped through. The more timid ones peered forward, shrank back, rubbed their ears,
scratched their cheeks, shouted, and yelled at the top of their voices, before going in, all clinging to each
other. After rushing across the bridge they all grabbed plates and snatched bowls, bagged stoves and fought
over beds, and moved everything around. Monkeys are born naughty and they could not keep quiet for a
single moment until they had worn themselves out moving things around.
The stone monkey sat himself in the main seat and said, "Gentlemen, A man who breaks his word is
worthless. Just now you said that if anyone was clever enough to come in here and get out again in one piece,
you'd make him king. Well, then. I've come in and gone out, and gone out and come in. I've found you
gentlemen a cave heaven where you can sleep in peace and all settle down to live in bliss. Why haven't you
made me king?" On hearing this all the monkeys bowed and prostrated themselves, not daring to disobey.
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 9
They lined up in groups in order of age and paid their homage as at court, all acclaiming him as the "Great
King of a Thousand Years." The stone monkey then took the throne, made the word "stone" taboo, and called
himself Handsome Monkey King. There is a poem to prove it that goes:
All things are born from the Three positives;
The magic stone was quick with the essence of sun and moon.
An egg was turned into a monkey to complete the Great Way;
He was lent a name so that the elixir would be complete.
Looking inside he perceives nothing because it has no form,
Outside he uses his intelligence to create visible things.
Men have always been like this:
Those who are called kings and sages do just as they wish.
Taking control of his host of monkeys, apes, gibbons and others, the Handsome Monkey King divided them
into rulers and subjects, assistants and officers. In the morning they roamed the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit
and in the evening they settled down for the night in the Water Curtain Cave. They made a compact that they
would not join the ranks of the birds or go with the running beasts. They had their own king, and they
thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
In spring they picked flowers for food and drink,
In summer they lived off fruit.
In autumn they gathered tares and chestnuts,
They got through the winter on Solomon's−seal.
The Handsome Monkey King's innocent high spirits could not, of course, last three or four hundred years.
One day he suddenly felt depressed during a banquet with his monkey host, and he started to weep. The
startled monkeys crowded round, bowed to him and asked, "What's the matter, Your Majesty?"
"Although I'm happy now," the Monkey King replied, "I'm worried about the future. That's what's getting me
down."
The other monkeys laughed and said, "Your Majesty is being greedy. We have parties every day; we live in a
mountain paradise, in an ancient cave in a divine continent. We are spared the rule of unicorns, the
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 10
domination of phoenixes, and the restraints of human kings. We are free to do just as we like−−we are
infinitely lucky. Why make yourself miserable worrying about the future?"
To this the Monkey King replied, "Yes, we don't have to submit to the laws and regulations of human kings,
and we don't live in terror of the power of birds and beasts. But the time will come when we are old and weak,
and the underworld is controlled by the King of Hell. When the time comes for us to die, we won't be able to
go on living among the Blessed, and our lives will have been in vain." All the monkeys covered their faces
and wept as everyone of them thought about death.
Suddenly a gibbon jumped out from their ranks and shrieked in a piercing voice, "If Your Majesty is thinking
so far ahead, this is the beginning of enlightenment. Now of the Five Creatures, there are only three that do
not come under the jurisdiction of the King of Hell."
"Do you know which they are?" asked the Monkey King.
"Yes," the ape replied. "They are the Buddhas, the Immortals and the Sages. They are free from the Wheel of
Reincarnation. They are not born and they do not die. They are as eternal as Heaven and Earth, as the
mountains and the rivers."
"Where do they live?" the Monkey King asked.
"Only in the human world," the ape replied, "in ancient caves on magic mountains." The Monkey King was
delighted to hear this.
"I shall leave you all tomorrow," he said, "and go down the mountain. If I have to, I'll roam the corners of the
oceans and go to the edge of the sky to find these three kinds of beings and discover the secret of eternal youth
that will keep us out of the clutches of the King of Hell for ever." Goodness! Because of these words he was
to learn how to be free from the Wheel of Reincarnation and become the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.
All the monkeys clapped with approval and said, "Great! Great! Tomorrow we'll climb all over the mountain
and get lots of fruit to give Your Majesty a really big banquet to send you off."
The next day the monkeys set out to pick magic peaches, gather rare fruits, dig out yams, and cut
Solomon's−seal. Magic fungus and fragrant orchid were collected, and everything was set on the stone
benches and the stone tables, with fairy wine and dishes. You could see
Golden pills and pearl pellets,
Bursting red and plump yellow.
The golden pills and pearl pellets were winter cherries, beautiful and sweet;
The bursting red and plump yellow were ripe plums, tasty and sharp.
Fresh, sweet−fleshed longans with thin skins.
Fiery lichees with tiny stones in a red sack.
Branch after branch of crab−apples,
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 11
Yellow−skinned loquats with their leaves on.
Rabbit−head pears and chicken−heart jujubes
To quench your thirst, remove your cares, and sober you up.
Fragrant peaches and tender apricots,
As sweet and luscious as jade wine.
Crisp plums and arbutus,
As sharp as glistening yogurt.
Ripe melons with red coats and black seeds,
Big, four−sectioned persimmons with yellow skins.
Bursting pomegranates:
Cinnabar pips shining like fire−crystal pearls.
Opened water−chestnuts
With firm round flesh like golden agate.
Walnuts and gingko fruits to eat with tea;
Coconuts and grapes to make into wine.
Dishes loaded with pine cones, yew−nuts, filberts, and crab−apples;
Tangerines, sugar−cane and oranges covering the table.
Hot roast yams,
Tender boiled Solomon's−seal.
Pounded china−root and Job's tears.
Simmered in soup in a stone−pot.
Although we humans have rare delicacies to eat,
We are no happier than those monkeys in the mountains.
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 12
The host of monkeys ushered the Handsome Monkey King to the seat of honour and sat down below him
according to age. Each of them took it in turns to bring him wine, flowers, and fruit, and they drank hard for a
whole day. The next morning the Handsome Monkey King got up early and ordered, "Children, tear down
some old pines and make me a raft. Find a bamboo pole to punt with and load it up with fruit. I'm going." He
went aboard the raft all by himself, pushed off with all his might, and floated off towards the waves of the
ocean. He intended to sail with the wind and cross over to the Southern Jambu Continent.
The heaven−born monkey, whose conduct was so noble,
Left his island to drift with heaven's winds.
He sailed oceans and seas to find the Way of Immortality,
Deeply determined to do a great deed.
The predestined one should not have vulgar longings;
He can attain the primal truth without care or worry.
He is bound to find a kindred spirit,
To explain the origins and the laws of nature.
He had chosen just the right time for his journey. After he boarded his raft the Southeasterly wind blew hard
for days on end and bore him to the Northwestern shore of the Southern Continent. Testing the depth of the
water with his pole he found that it was shallow, so he abandoned the raft and jumped ashore. He saw humans
by the coast, fishing, hunting geese, gathering clams, and extracting salt. He went up to them, leaping around
and making faces, which so scared them that they dropped their baskets and nets and fled in all directions as
fast as they could. The Monkey King grabbed one of them who was a poor runner, stripped him of his clothes,
and dressed himself in them like a human. He swaggered through the provinces and prefectures, learning
human behavior and human speech in the market places. Whether he was eating his breakfast or going to bed
at nigh he was always asking about Buddhas, Immortals and Sages, and seeking the secret of eternal youth.
He observed that the people of the world were too concerned with fame and fortune to be interested in their
fates.
When will the struggle for fame and fortune end?
Toiling from morning till night, never pleasing yourself.
Those who ride donkeys long for stallions,
The Prime Minister always wants to be a prince.
They only worry about having to stop work to eat or dress;
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 13
They never fear that the King of Hell will come to get them.
When trying to ensure their sons and grandsons inherit their wealth and power,
They have no time to stop and think.
Although he asked about the way of the Immortals, the Monkey King was unable to meet one. He spent eight
or nine years in the Southern Jambu Continent, going through its great walls and visiting its little counties.
When he found that he had reached the Great Western Ocean he thought that there must be Sages and
Immortals on the other side of it, so he made himself another raft like the last one, and floated across the
Western Ocean until he came to the Western Continent of Cattle−gift. He went ashore and made extensive
and lengthy enquiries until one day he came upon a high and beautiful mountain, thickly forested on its lower
slopes. Not fearing wolves, and undaunted by tigers or leopards, he climbed to the summit to see the view. It
was indeed a fine mountain:
A thousand peaks brandishing halberds,
Screens ten thousand measures tall.
In the sunlight the mountain haze is lightly touched with blue;
After the rain the black rocks look coldly green.
Withered creepers coil round ancient trees,
And the old ford marks the bounds of the mysterious.
Strange flowers and precious plants,
Flourishing in all four seasons, rivaling fairyland.
The nearby cry of a hidden bird,
The clear running of a spring.
Valley upon valley of mushroom and orchid,
Lichen grows all over the cliffs.
The range rises and dips in dragon−like majesty.
Surely there mush be lofty hermits here.
As he was looking at the view the Monkey King heard a human voice coming from the depths of the forest.
He rushed into the trees, and when he cocked his ear to listen he heard a song:
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 14
"Watching the chess game I cut through the rotten,
Felling trees, ding, ding,
Strolling at the edge of the cloud and the mouth of the valley,
I sell firewood to buy wine,
Cackling with laughter and perfectly happy.
I pillow myself on a pine root, looking up at the moon.
When I wake up it is light.
Recognizing the old forest
I scale cliffs and cross ridges,
Cutting down withered creepers with my axe.
When I've gathered a basketful
I walk down to the market with a song,
And trade it for three pints of rice.
Nobody else competes with me,
So prices are stable.
I don't speculate or try sharp practice,
Couldn't care less what people think of me,
Calmly lengthening my days.
The people I meet
Are Taoists and Immortals,
Sitting quietly and expounding the Yellow Court."
The Monkey King was overjoyed to hear this, and he said with glee, "So this is where the Immortals have
been hiding." He bounded deeper into the woods for a closer look and saw that the singer was a woodcutter
cutting firewood. He was wearing the most unusual clothes:
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 15
On his head he wore a hat
Woven from the first skin shed by new bamboo shoots.
The clothes on his body
Were made of yam from the wild cotton−tree.
The belt round his waist
Was of silk from an old silkworm.
The straw sandals under his feet
Had straps torn from rotten sago trees.
In his hand he held a steel axe
On his back he carried a hempen rope
At climbing pines and felling dead trees,
Who was a match for this woodcutter?
The Monkey King went closer and called to him. "Old Immortal, your disciple greets you."
The woodcutter dropped his axe in astonishment and turned round to say, "No, no. I don't even have enough
to eat or drink, so how can I possibly let you call me an Immortal?"
"If you're not an Immortal," the Monkey King said, "why do you talk like one?"
"I don't talk like an Immortal," the woodcutter said.
"At the edge of the wood just now," the Monkey King replied, "I heard you say, 'The people I meet are
Taoists and Immortals, sitting quietly and expounding the Mantingfang.' The Mantingfang contains the truth
about the Way, so if you're not an Immortal, what are you?" The woodcutter laughed.
"It's quite true that the song is called 'The Fragrance of the Mantingfang,' and an Immortal who lives near my
hut taught me it. He said he saw how hard I had to work and how I was always worried, so he made me sing
this song when things were getting me down. It lightens my cares and makes me forget my weariness. I was
singing it just now because I had some problems on my mind, and I never imagined that you would be
listening."
"If you've got an Immortal for a neighbour, you ought to learn from him how to cultivate your conduct and get
him to teach you a recipe for eternal youth."
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 16
"I've had a hard life," the woodcutter replied. "My mother and father brought me up till I was about eight, and
just when I was beginning to know about life my father died. My mother remained a widow, and I had no
brothers or sisters. As I was the only child I had to look after my mother morning and night. Now she is old
that I can't possibly leave her. Our land is so overgrown that I can't grow enough to feed and clothe both of us,
so I have to cut a couple of bundles of firewood to sell in the market for a handful of coppers to buy the few
pints of rice that I cook for myself and for my mother. That's why I can't cultivate my conduct."
"From what you say," the Monkey King replied, "you're a filial son and a gentleman−−you're bound to be
rewarded for it one day. But I'd be grateful if you could show me where that Immortal lives, so that I can go
and pay him my respects."
The woodcutter said, "It's not far from here. This mountain is the Spirit Tower Heart Mountain, and in it there
is the Cave of the Setting Moon and the Three Stars. In that cave lives an Immortal called the Patriarch
Subhuti. I don't know how many disciples he has trained−−there are thirty or forty of them cultivating their
conduct with him at the moment. If you take that path South for two or three miles you'll reach his home."
The Monkey King tugged at the woodcutter and said, "Take me there, Elder Brother. If I get anything out of
this, I won't forget your kindness."
"You idiot," the woodcutter replied, "didn't you understand what I told you just now? If I went with you I
wouldn't be able to earn my living, and who would look after my poor old mother then? I've got to get on with
my woodcutting. Go by yourself."
After hearing this the Monkey King had to take his leave. He came out of the forest and found the path, which
led up a mountain slope for two or three miles, when he saw the cave. He pulled himself up to his full height
to take a look, and it was a really magnificent place:
Misty clouds scattered colours,
Sun and moon shimmered bright.
A thousand ancient cypresses,
Ten thousand lofty bamboos.
A thousand ancient cypresses,
A soft green drawing the rain from the sky.
Ten thousand lofty bamboos,
And a misty valley is azure blue.
Outside the gate rare flowers spread brocade;
Beside the bridge wafts the scent of jade flowers.
Rocky crags jut, glossy with green moss;
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 17
On overhanging cliffs blue lichen grows.
Sometimes the call of the crane is heard
And often you see the phoenix soar.
The call of the crane
Echoes beyond the Ninth Heaven and the Milky Way.
When the phoenix soars,
The brilliance of its wings colours the clouds.
Black apes and white deer can be just made out;
Golden lions and jade elephants prefer to keep hidden.
If you look closely at this happy land,
You will see that it rivals paradise.
He saw that the doors of the cave were shut fast, and that everything was still, with no signs of any people. He
turned round and noticed that there was a stone tablet about thirty feet high and eight feet wide at the top of
the cliff. On it was carved in enormous letters: SPIRIT−TOWER HEART MOUNTAIN, CAVE OF THE
SETTING MOON AND THE THREE STARS. The Monkey King exclaimed with delight, "The people here
really are honest. The mountain and the cave do exist." He took a good long look, but did not dare to knock on
the door. He climbed to the and of a pine branch and ate some pine seeds to amuse himself.
Before long the doors of the cave opened with a creak, and an immortal boy came out. In the nobility of his
bearing and the exceptional purity of his features he was completely different from an ordinary boy.
His hair was bound with a pair of silken bands,
His flowing gown had two capacious sleeves.
His face and body were naturally distinguished;
His mind and appearance were both empty.
For many years a guest beyond the world of things,
An eternal child amid the mountains,
Untouched by any speck of dust,
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 18
He let the years go tumbling by.
When this boy had come out he shouted, "Who's making that row out here?"
The Monkey King scampered down the tree, went up to him, and said with a bow, "Immortal child, I am a
disciple who has come to ask about the Way and study under the Immortal. The last thing I'd do would be to
make a row here?" The boy laughed.
"So you've come to ask about the Way, have you?"
"Yes," the Monkey King replied.
"Our master has just got up," the boy said, "and has now mounted the dais to expound the Way. Before he had
started to explain about origins he told me to open the door. He said, 'There is someone outside who wants to
cultivate his conduct. Go and welcome him.' I suppose he must have meant you."
"Yes, he meant me," the Monkey King said with a smile.
"Come with me," the boy said.
The Monkey King straightened his clothes and followed the boy deep into the depths of the cave. He saw
majestic pavilions and towers of red jade, pearl palaces and gateways of cowry, and countless rooms of
silence and secluded cells leading all the way to a jasper dais. He saw the Patriarch Subhuti sitting on the dais
and thirty−six minor Immortals standing below it.
A golden Immortal of great enlightenment, free from filth,
Subhuti, the marvel of the Western World.
Neither dying nor born, he practices the triple meditation,
His spirit and soul entirely benevolent.
In empty detachment he follows the changes;
Having found his true nature he lets it run free.
As eternal as Heaven, and majestic in body,
The great teacher of the Law is enlightened through aeons.
As soon as the Handsome Monkey King saw him he bowed low and knocked his head on the ground before
him many times, saying, "Master, master, your disciple pays his deepest respects."
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 19
"Where are you from?" the Patriarch asked. "You must tell me your name and address before you can become
my pupil."
"I come from the Water Curtain Cave in the Flowers and Fruit Mountain in the land of Aolai in the Eastern
Continent of Superior Body," replied the Monkey King.
"Throw him out," the Patriarch roared. "He's a liar and a cheat, and even if he tried cultivating his conduct he
would get nowhere."
The Monkey King desperately kept hitting his head on the ground and said, "Your disciple spoke the truth. I
promise I wasn't lying."
The Patriarch asked, "If you were speaking the truth, why did you say that you came from the Eastern
Continent of Superior Body? Between here and the Eastern Continent there are two seas and the Southern
Jambu Continent, so how could you possibly have come here from there?"
The Monkey King, still kowtowing, replied, "I sailed across seas and oceans, crossed frontiers and wandered
through many countries for over ten years before I arrived here."
"So you came here by stages," the Patriarch remarked. "What is your surname?"
"I'm not surly," the Monkey King replied. "If people call me names it doesn't bother me, and if they hit me I
don't get angry. I'm just polite to them and that's that. I've never been surly."
"I didn't ask if you were surly. I wanted to know the surname you inherited from your parents."
"I didn't have any parents," the Monkey King replied.
"If you had no parents, did you grow on a tree?"
"I grew not on a tree but in a stone," the Monkey King replied. "All I remember is that there was a magic
stone on the top of the Flower and Fruit Mountain, and that one year the stone split open and I was born."
Concealing his delight at searing this, the Patriarch remarked, "In other words, you were born of Heaven and
Earth. Walk around for a moment and let me have a look at you." The Monkey King leapt to his feet and
shambled round a couple of times.
The Patriarch smiled and said, "Though you have rather a base sort of body, you look like one of the rhesus
monkeys that eat pine seeds, and I ought to give you a surname that fits your appearance and call you Hu
('Macaque'). The elements that make up the character Hu are 'animal,' 'old' and 'moon'. What is old is ancient,
and the moon embodies the Negative principle, and what is ancient and Negative cannot be transformed. But I
think I would do much better to call you Sun ('Monkey'). Apart from the 'animal' element, the character Sun
has one part implying male and one part suggesting a baby, which fits in with my basic theories about
children. Your surname will be Sun."
When the Monkey King heard this he kowtowed with delight and said, "Great! Great! Now I have a surname.
I am eternally grateful to you for your mercy and compassion, master. I beg you to give me a personal name
to go with my new surname, then it will be much easier to address me."
"There are twelve words within my sect," said the Patriarch, "which I give as names. You belong to the tenth
generation of my disciples."
Journey to the West
Chapter 1 20
"What are these twelve words?" asked the Monkey King.
"Broad, great, wisdom, intelligence, true, likeness, nature, sea, bright, awakened, complete and enlightenment.
If we work out the generations of disciples, then you should have a name with Wu ('Awakened') in it. So we
can give you the Dharma−name Sun Wukong, which means 'Monkey Awakened to Emptiness'. Will that do?"
"Marvellous, marvellous," said the smiling Monkey King. "From now on my name will be Sun Wukong."
Indeed:
When the Great Vagueness was separated there were no surnames;
To smash foolish emptiness he had to be awakened to emptiness.
If you want to know what success he had in cultivating his conduct, you must listen to the explanation in the
next installment.
Chapter 2
He Becomes Aware of the Wonderful Truth of Enlightenment
By Killing the Demon He Realizes His Spirit−Nature
The story goes on to tell how after being given a name the Handsome Monkey King jumped for joy and
bowed to Subhuti to express his thanks. The Patriarch then ordered the others to take Sun Wukong out
through the double doors and teach him how to sprinkle and sweep the floor, answer orders, and deport
himself properly. All the Immortals went out in obedience to this command. When Sun Wukong was outside
the doors he bowed to all his spiritual elder brothers and laid out his bed on the verandah. The next morning
and every following day he studied language and deportment under his spiritual elder brothers, expounded the
scriptures, discussed the Way, practiced calligraphy, and burnt incense. When he had any spare time he would
sweep the grounds, dig the vegetable patch, grow flowers, tend trees, look for kindling, light the fire, carry
water, and fetch soy. Everything he needed was provided. Thus six or seven years slipped by in the cave
without his noticing them. One day the Patriarch took his seat on the dais, called all the Immortals together,
and began to explain the Great Way.
Heavenly flowers fell in profusion,
While golden lotuses burst forth from the earth.
Brilliantly he expounded the doctrine of the Three Vehicles,
Setting forth ten thousand Dharmas in all their details.
As he slowly waved his whisk, jewels fell from his mouth,
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 21
Echoing like thunder and shaking the Nine Heavens.
Now preaching the Way,
Now teaching meditation,
He showed that the Three Beliefs are basically the same.
In explaining a single word he brought one back to the truth,
And taught the secrets of avoiding birth and understanding one's nature.
As Monkey sat at the side listening to the exposition he was so delighted that he tugged at his ear, scratched
his cheek and smiled. He could not help waving his hands and stamping. When the Patriarch noticed this he
said to Monkey, "Why are you leaping around like a madman in class instead of listening to the lesson?"
"Your disciple is listening to the exposition with all his attention," Monkey replied, "but your marvellous
words made me so happy that I started jumping around without realizing what I was doing. Please forgive
me."
To this the Patriarch replied, "If you really understand my marvellous words, then answer this question. How
long have you been in my cave?"
"You disciple was born stupid," Monkey replied, "so I've no idea how long I've been here. All I know is that
whenever the fire in the stove goes out I go to the other side of the mountain to collect firewood and there I
see a hill covered with fine peach trees. I've had seven good feeds of peaches there."
"That hill is called Tender Peach Hill. If you have eaten there seven times you must have been here seven
years. What sort of Way do you want to learn from me?"
"That depends what you teach me, master. As long as there's a whiff of Way to it, your disciple will learn it."
"There are three hundred and sixty side−entrances to the Way, and they all lead to a True Result," the
Patriarch said. "Which branch would you like to study?"
"I will do whatever you think best, master," replied Monkey.
"What about teaching you the Way of Magic Arts?"
"What does 'the Way of Magic Arts' mean?"
"Magic arts," the Patriarch replied, "include summoning Immortals, using the magic sandboard, and divining
by milfoil. With them one can learn how to bring on good fortune and avert disaster."
"Can you become immortal this way?" asked Monkey.
"No, certainly not," replied the Patriarch.
"No. Shan't learn it."
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 22
"Shall I teach you the Way of Sects?" the Patriarch asked.
"What are the principles of the Sects?" said Monkey.
"Within the branch of Sects, there is Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, the study of the Negative and
Positive, Mohism, medicine, reading scriptures and chanting the name of a Buddha. You can also summon
Immortals and Sages with this branch."
"Can you attain immortality that way?" asked Monkey.
"To try and attain immortality that way," the Patriarch replied, "is like 'putting a pillar in the wall.'"
"Master," Monkey said, "I'm a simple chap and I can't understand your technical jargon. What do you mean
by 'putting a pillar in the wall?'"
"When a man builds a house and wants to make it strong he puts a pillar in the wall. But when the day comes
for his mansion to collapse the pillar is bound to rot."
"From what you say," Monkey observed, "it's not eternal. No. Shan't learn it."
"Shall I teach you the Way of Silence?" the Patriarch then asked.
"What True Result can be got from Silence?" said Monkey.
"It involves abstaining from grain, preserving one's essence, silence, inaction, meditation, abstaining from
speech, eating vegetarian food, performing certain exercises when asleep or standing up, going into trances,
and being walled up in total isolation."
"Is this a way of becoming immortal?" Monkey asked.
"It's like building the top of a kiln with sun−dried bricks," the patriarch replied.
"You do go on, master," said Sun Wukong. "I've already told you that I can't understand your technical jargon.
What does 'building the top of a kiln with sun−dried bricks' mean?"
"If you build the top of a kiln with sun−dried bricks they may make it look all right, but if they have not been
hardened with fire and water, then they will crumble away in the first heavy rainstorm."
"There's nothing eternal about that either, then," replied Monkey. "No. Shan't learn that."
"Shall I teach you the Way of Action then?" the Patriarch asked.
"What's that like?" Monkey asked.
"It involves acting and doing, extracting the Negative and building up the Positive, drawing the bow and
loading the crossbow, rubbing the navel to make the subtle humors flow, refining elixirs according to
formulae, lighting fires under cauldrons, consuming 'Red lead,' purifying 'Autumn Stone,' and drinking
women's milk."
"Can doing things like that make me live for ever?" Monkey asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 23
"To try and attain immortality that way is like 'lifting the moon out of water.'"
"What does 'lifting the moon out of water' mean?"
"The moon is in the sky," the Patriarch replied, "and only its reflection is in the water. Although you can see it
there, you will try in vain to lift it out."
"No. Shan't learn that," Monkey exclaimed.
When the Patriarch heard this he gasped and climbed down from his dais. Pointing at Sun Wukong with his
cane he said, "You won't study this and you won't study that, so what do you want, you monkey?" He went up
to Monkey and hit him three times on the head, then went inside with his hands behind his back and shut the
main door, abandoning them all. The class was shocked, and they all blamed Sun Wukong.
"You cheeky ape, you've no idea how to behave. The master was teaching you the Way, so why did you have
to argue with him instead of learning from him? Now you've offended him we don't know when he'll come
out again." They were all very angry with him and regarded him with loathing and contempt. But Sun
Wukong was not bothered in the least, and his face was covered with smiles.
The Monkey King had understood the riddle, and had the answer hidden away in his mind. So he did not
argue with the others but bore it all without a word. When the Patriarch hit him three times he had been telling
him to pay attention at the third watch; and when he went inside with his hands behind his back and shut the
main door he had told the Monkey King to go in through the back door and be taught the Way in secret.
The delighted Sun Wukong spent the rest of that day with the others in front of the Three Stars Cave, looking
at the sky and impatient for night to come. At dusk he went to bed like all the others, pretended to close his
eyes, controlled his breathing, and calmed himself down. Nobody beats the watches or calls out the hour in
the mountains, so he had no way of knowing the time except by regulating the breath going in and out of his
nose. When he reckoned that it was about the third watch he got up very quietly, dressed, and slipped out
through the front door away from the others. When he was outside he looked up and saw
The moon was bright and clear and cold,
The vast space of the eight points was free from dust.
Deep in the trees a bird slept hidden,
While the water flowed from the spring.
Fireflies scattered their lights
And a line of geese was stretched across the clouds.
It was exactly the third watch,
The right time to ask about the Way.
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 24
Watch the Monkey King as he follows the old path to the back door, which he found to be ajar. "The Patriarch
has left the door open, so he really intends to teach me the Way," he exclaimed in delight. He tiptoed toward,
went in sideways through the door, and walked over to the Patriarch's bed, where he saw the Patriarch
sleeping curled up, facing the inside of the room. Not daring to disturb him, Sun Wukong knelt in front of the
bed. Before long the Patriarch woke up, stretched out both his legs, and mumbled to himself:
"It's hard, hard, hard. The Way is very obscure,
Don't make light of the Gold and the Cinnabar.
To teach miraculous spells to any but the Perfect Man,
Is to tire the voice and dry the tongue in vain."
Sun Wukong said in reply, "Master, your disciple has been kneeling here for a long time."
When the Patriarch heard that it was Sun Wukong who was speaking he pulled some clothes on, sat up
cross−legged, and shouted, "It's that monkey. Why have you come into my room instead of sleeping out in
front?"
"Master, you told me publicly in front of the altar yesterday that your disciple was to come in here through the
back gate at the third watch as you were going to teach me the Way. That is why I made so bold as to come to
pay my respects beside my master's bed."
The Patriarch was very pleased to hear this and said to himself, "This wretch was indeed born of Heaven and
Earth. Otherwise he wouldn't have been able to understand my cryptic message."
Sun Wukong said, "There is no third pair of ears in this room; your disciple is the only other person here. I
hope, master, that in your great mercy you will teach me the Way of Immortality. If you do, I'll always be
grateful to you."
"You are predestined," the Patriarch said, "so I shall be happy to tell you. Since you understood my cryptic
message, come over here and listen carefully while I teach you the miraculous Way of Immortality." Sun
Wukong kowtowed with gratitude and knelt before the bed, listening with all his attention. The Patriarch said:
"True spells, revealing secrets and all powerful,
Are the only sure way of protecting one's life.
They all come from essence, vapour, and spirit,
Must be stored away securely, and never be divulged.
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 25
Must never be divulged, and be stored in the body,
Then the Way I teach you will flourish of itself.
Many are the benefits of learning spells:
They give protection from evil desires and make one pure.
Make one pure with a dazzling radiance
Like a bright moon shining on a cinnabar tower.
The moon contains a Jade Rabbit, the sun a Golden Crow,
The Tortoise and the Snake are always intertwined.
Always intertwined, then life is firm,
And one can plant golden lotuses in fire.
Grasp all the Five Elements and turn them upside down,
And when you are successful you can become a Buddha, or an Immortal."
The Patriarch's explanation went to the root of things, and Sun Wukong's heart was filled with bliss as he
committed the spells to memory. He bowed to the Patriarch to express his deep gratitude and went out of the
back door to look. He saw that there was a trace of white in the East, while the golden light of the moon was
shining in the West. He went to the front door by the old path, pushed it open gently, and went in.
He sat down where he had been sleeping earlier, shook his bedding and said loudly, "It's dawn, it's dawn. Get
up." The others were all asleep, unaware of Sun Wukong's good fortune. At daybreak he got up and muddled
through the day, while secretly keeping to what he had been told. In the afternoon and evening he regulated
his breathing.
After three years had passed in this way the Patriarch once more sat on his lecturing throne and expounded the
Dharma to the students. He recounted famous sayings and parables, and discussed external phenomena and
external appearances.
Without warning he asked, "Where is Sun Wukong?" Sun Wukong went forward, knelt down and replied,
"Your disciple is present."
"What Way have you cultivated since coming here?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 26
"Your disciple is now fairly well conversant with the Dharma," Sun Wukong replied, "and my Source is
getting gradually stronger."
"If you are conversant with the Dharma and you know about the Source," the Patriarch replied, "and if the
spirit has already flowed into you, then you must beware of the 'Three Disasters.'"
Sun Wukong thought for a long time, then he said, "Patriarch, you're talking rubbish. I have often heard that
the Way is lofty and its power mighty, that it is as eternal as Heaven, that it can overcome fire and water, and
prevent all illnesses from arising, so how could there be "Three Disasters?'"
To this the Patriarch replied, "This is not the ordinary Way: it involves seizing the very creation of Heaven
and Earth, and encroaching on the hidden workings of the sun and moon. Once the elixir is made, devils and
spirits cannot tolerate it. Although it will preserve the youthfulness of your face and prolong your life, in five
hundred years' time Heaven will strike you with a thunderbolt. You must be clear−sighted in nature and mind,
so that you can hide from it before it comes. If you succeed in avoiding it you will live as long as Heaven; and
if you don't, it will kill you. Another five hundred years later Heaven will burn you with fire. This fire will be
not heavenly fire or ordinary fire but 'hidden fire'. It will burn you from the soles of your feet to the crown of
your head; your five viscera will be reduced to ashes, your four limbs will be destroyed, and a thousand years
of asceticism will have been so much wasted time. Yet another five hundred years later a wind will blow at
you. It will not be the North, South, East, or West wind, nor will it be a warm, fragrant wind from the
Northwest; nor will it be the kind of wind that blows among flowers, willows, pine, and bamboo. It will be
what is called a 'monster wind'. It will blow through the crown of your head down into your six entrails. It will
go through the Cinnabar Field below your navel and penetrate your nine orifices. Your flesh and your bones
will be destroyed and your body will disintegrate. So you must avoid all three of these disasters."
When he heard this Sun Wukong's hair stood on end, and he kowtowed with the words, "I implore you, my
lord, to show pity and teach me how to avoid these three disasters. If you do I will be grateful to you for ever."
"That would be easy," the Patriarch replied, "but for the fact that you are different from other people−−which
means that I can't."
"I have a head that faces the sky and feet standing on earth," said Sun Wukong. "I have nine orifices and four
limbs, five viscera and six entrails. How am I different from anyone else?"
"Although you are quite like other people, your cheeks are too small." Now the Monkey had a funny face,
with cheeks that caved inwards and a sharp chin.
Sun Wukong felt it with his hand and replied with a laugh, "Master, you didn't take everything into account.
Although I'm a bit short of jaw, I've got more dewlap than other people to make up for it."
"Very well then," the Patriarch said, "which would you prefer to learn: the thirty−six heavenly transformations
or the seventy−two earthly ones?"
"Your disciple wants to get as much out of it as he can, so I would like to learn the seventy−two earthly ones."
"If that's what you want," the Patriarch replied, "come here and I'll teach you the spells." Thereupon he
whispered into Sun Wukong's ear, and who knows what miraculous spells he taught him? The Monkey King
was the sort of person who understands everything once he is told a tiny part, and he learned the spells on the
spot. He practiced and trained until he had mastered all seventy−two transformations. One day the Patriarch
and all his disciples were enjoying the sunset outside the Three Stars Cave.
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 27
The Patriarch asked Sun Wukong, "Have you succeeded yet?"
Sun Wukong replied, "Thanks to your infinite mercy, master, your disciple's results have been perfect, and I
can now rise on the clouds and fly."
"Let me see you try a flight," the Patriarch said. Sun Wukong used his skill to perform a series of somersaults
that carried him fifty or sixty feet into the air, then walked around on the clouds for about as long as it takes to
eat a meal.
He covered about a mile altogether before landing in front of the Patriarch, folding his arms across his chest,
and saying, "Master, that's flying and soaring in the clouds." The Patriarch laughed.
"That's not soaring on the clouds−−it's just climbing up them. There is an old saying that 'an Immortal visits
the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the evening'. But to take as long as you did just to go a mile
doesn't count as climbing on the clouds."
"How can it be possible to visit the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the evening?" Sun Wukong
asked.
"All cloud−soarers start off from the Northern Sea early in the morning, visit the Eastern, Western and
Southern Seas, and then come back to Cangwu; Cangwu is what the Northern Sea is called in the Lingling
language. When you can go beyond all four seas in a single day you can regard yourself as a cloud−soarer."
"But that must be very difficult," Sun Wukong observed.
"Where there's a will there's a way," the Patriarch replied.
"Nothing by halves, master," replied Sun Wukong with bows and kowtows, "I beg of you in your great mercy
to teach me the art of cloud−soaring. I promise that I will always be grateful."
"Immortals take off with a stamp of their feet," said the Patriarch, "but you do it differently−−just now I saw
you pull yourself up. As that is the way you do it, I'll show you how to do it your own way and teach you the
'somersault cloud.'" Sun Wukong bowed again, imploring him to do so, and the Patriarch taught him the spell.
"For this kind of cloud," the Patriarch said, "you make the magic by clasping your hands in the special way,
recite the words of the spell, clench your fist, shake yourself, and jump. With one somersault you can go sixty
thousand miles." When the others heard this they all exclaimed with a laugh.
"Lucky old Sun Wukong. With magic like this he could be−a messenger delivering official letters and reports,
and he'd never go short of a meal." When it was dark the Patriarch and his pupils returned to the cave. That
night Sun Wukong moved his spirit, practiced the technique, and mastered the cloud somersault. From then on
he was free from all restraint and he enjoyed the delights of immortality, drifting around as he pleased.
On a day when spring was giving way to summer, and all the students had been sitting under some pine trees
listening to lectures for a long time, they said, "Sun Wukong, in what life did you earn your present destiny?
The other day our teacher whispered to you how to do the transformations to avoid the Three Disasters. Can
you do them all yet?"
"It's true, brothers," said Sun Wukong with a grin, "I can do them all. In the first place, it's because our master
taught me; and in the second place, it's because I practiced them hard day and night."
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 28
"This would be a good time for you to give us a demonstration." At this suggestion Sun Wukong braced his
spirit to show off his skill.
"What's it to be, brothers? Tell me what you'd like me to turn myself into."
"Turn into a pine tree," they all said. Sun Wukong clenched his fist, said the magic words, shook himself, and
changed into a pine tree. It was truly
Green and misty throughout the four seasons,
Raising its upright beauty to the clouds.
Not in the least like a demon monkey,
Every inch a tree that withstands frost and snow.
When the students saw it they clapped their hands and chuckled aloud, saying, "Good old monkey, good old
monkey." They did not realize that the row they were making had disturbed the Patriarch, who rushed out
through the door, dragging his stick behind him.
"Who's making a row out here?" he asked. The students hurriedly pulled themselves together, straightened
their clothes and went over to him.
Sun Wukong, who had now resumed his real appearance, said from the forest, "Master, we were holding a
discussion here, and there were no outsiders making a din."
"Yelling and shouting like that," the Patriarch angrily roared, "is no way for those cultivating their conduct to
behave. If you are cultivating your conduct, the subtle vapours escape when you open your mouth, and when
you wag your tongue, trouble starts. What was all the laughing and shouting about"
"Just now Sun Wukong did a transformation for fun. We told him to turn himself into a pine tree, and he did.
We all praised and applauded him, which was why we disturbed you with the noise, master. We beg you to
forgive us."
The Patriarch sent them all away except for Sun Wukong, to whom he said, "Come here. Is that a way to use
your spirit? To change into a pine tree? Is this a skill you should be showing off in front of people? If you saw
somebody else doing that, wouldn't you ask him to teach you? If other people see you doing it, they're bound
to ask you to teach them, and if you want to keep out of trouble you'll have to do so; otherwise they may do
you harm, and then your life will be in danger."
Sun Wukong kowtowed and said, "Please forgive me, master."
"I shan't punish you," the Patriarch replied, "but you'll have to go." Sun Wukong's eyes filled with tears.
"Master, where am I to go?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 29
"Go back to where you came from." Sun Wukong had a sudden awakening, and he said, "I came from the
Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of
Superior Body."
"If you hurry back there," the Patriarch replied, "you will be able to preserve your life. If you stay here it will
be absolutely impossible to do so." Sun Wukong accepted his punishment.
"Yes, master," he said. "I've been away from home for twenty years and I do miss the old days and my
children and grandchildren. But when I remember that I have not yet repaid your enormous generosity to me, I
can't bring myself to go."
"What sort of kindness would you be doing me if you stayed? I'll be happy enough if you keep me out of any
disasters you cause."
Seeing that there was nothing else for it, Sun Wukong bowed and took leave of him, saying good−bye to all
the other students.
"Now that you're going," the Patriarch said, "I'm sure that your life will not be a good one. Whatever disasters
you cause and crimes you commit, I forbid you under any circumstances to call yourself my disciple. If you so
much as hint at it I'll know at once, and I'll tear off your monkey skin, chop up your bones, and banish your
soul to the Ninth Darkness. I won't let you out for ten thousand aeons."
"I promise never to give away a single letter of your name," said Sun Wukong. "I'll just say that I taught
myself."
Sun Wukong took his leave and went away. Making the spell by clasping his fist he jumped head over heels,
summoned a somersault cloud, and went back to the Eastern Continent. Within two hours he saw the Water
Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. The Handsome Monkey King was so pleased that he said
to himself:
"When I left here my mortal flesh and bones were heavy,
But now I have the Way my body's light.
No one in the world has real determination,
To the firm will, the hidden becomes clear.
When I last crossed the seas the waves got in my way,
But now on my return the journey's easy.
The parting words still echo in my ears;
When will I see The Eastern Ocean again?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 30
Sun Wukong put away his cloud and headed straight to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. As he followed the
path there he heard the call of the cranes and the cries of the apes. The crane calls echoed beyond the Milky
Way, and the ape cries were pathetically sad.
Sun Wukong shouted, "Children, I'm back."
Big monkeys and little monkeys came bounding in their thousands and tens of thousands from caves in the
cliffs, from the grass and flowers, and down from the trees. They all crowded round the Handsome Monkey
King, kowtowed and said, "Your Majesty, you're a cool one. How could you stay away for so long,
abandoning us all here? We've been desperate for you to come back. A demon has been mistreating us
terribly. He's occupied our Water Curtain Cave, and we've been fighting for our lives with him. Recently he's
been stealing our things and carrying off many of our youngsters. We've had to stay awake all night to guard
our families. Thank goodness you've come back! Another year without you, Your Majesty, and every one of
us would be under his control, cave and all."
Sun Wukong was furious, "Who is this demon? What an outrage! Tell me everything about him, and then I'll
go and give him what's coming to him."
The monkey host kowtowed again and said, "Your Majesty, the wretch calls himself the Demon King of
Confusion. He lives North of here."
"How far away is his lair?" Sun Wukong asked.
"He comes and goes in cloud and mist with wind and rain, or thunder and lightning, so we don't know how far
it is."
"If that's how it is," Sun Wukong replied, "then don't worry. Just keep yourselves amused while I go and find
him."
The splendid Monkey King jumped up into the air, and as he somersaulted towards the North he saw a high
and precipitous mountain. It was a fine sight:
Perpendicular peaks jutting straight up,
Deep−sunk winding streams.
The perpendicular peaks jutting straight up pierced the sky;
The deep−sunk winding streams led to the underworld.
On pairs of cliffs the plants compete in strangeness;
Elsewhere pine vies in greenness with bamboo.
To the left are docile dragons,
To the right are tame tigers.
Iron oxen ploughing are a common sight,
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 31
Golden coins are always sown as seeds.
Hidden birds sing beautifully,
Red phoenixes stand in the sun.
Racing over stones, the clear waves
Twist and bend in a vicious torrent.
Many are the famous mountains in the world,
And many the flowers that bloom and wither on them.
But this scenery is eternal,
Unchanging through the four seasons.
It is truly the mountain from which the Three Worlds spring,
The Cave in the Belly of the Water that nourishes the Five Elements.
As the Handsome Monkey King stood gazing in silence at this view, he heard voices. When he went down the
mountainside to look he found the Cave in the Belly of the Water facing the cliff. Several minor demons were
dancing around in front of the cave doors, and they ran away as soon as they saw Sun Wukong.
"Wait a moment," Sun Wukong said. "I want you to take a message for me. I am the King of the Water
Curtain Cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit that lies due South of here. I've come to find that Demon
of Confusion of yours, or whatever he's called, the one who's been mistreating my children and grandchildren,
and have it out with him."
The minor demons scuttled into the cave and reported, "A disaster, Your Majesty."
"What do you mean, disaster?" the demon king asked.
"There's a monkey outside the cave," the minor demons reported, "who says that he's the King of the Water
Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. He says that you have been bullying his children and
grandchildren, and that he's come specially to find you to have it out with you." The demon king laughed.
"Those monkey devils are always going on about a king of theirs who renounced the world to cultivate his
conduct; I suppose it must be him who's here now. Did you see how he was dressed or what weapons he was
carrying?"
"He hasn't got any weapons. He's bareheaded, and he's wearing a red gown belted with a yellow silk sash, and
a pair of black boots. He isn't dressed like a monk, or a layman, or an Immortal. He's bare−handed and
empty−fisted, and he's standing outside the doors yelling."
"Bring me my armour and weapons," said the demon king when he heard this. The minor demons produced
them at once, and when he had donned his armour he went out of the door with all the demons, his sword in
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 32
his hand.
"Who is the King of the Water Curtain Cave?" he roared. Sun Wukong took a quick look at him and saw that
On his head he wore a dark golden helmet,
Glistening in the sun.
On his body he wore a black silk gown,
Flapping in the breeze.
Below that he wore black metal armour,
Girt with a leather belt.
On his feet he wore patterned boots,
As splendid as a field−marshal's.
His waist was ten feet round,
And his height was thirty cubits.
In his hand he held a sword,
With gleaming point and edge.
He called himself the Demon King of Confusion
And his appearance was truly dazzling.
"You insolent demon," shouted the Monkey King. "Your eyes may be big but you can't see who I am."
The demon king laughed at him. "You don't even stand four feet from the ground, you're still in your twenties,
and you've got no weapon in your hand. What sort of mad courage makes you challenge me to a fight?"
"You insolent demon," retorted Sun Wukong, "how blind you are. You may think I'm small, but I can grow
easily enough. You may think I'm unarmed, but I could pull the moon down from the sky with my two hands.
Don't worry, old Sun Wukong will sock you one." Sun Wukong gave a jump and leapt into the air, taking a
swing at his face.
The demon king put out his hand to stop him and said, "Look how big I am, you dwarf. If you use your fists,
I'll use my sword. But I'd only make myself look ridiculous if I killed you with a sword. Wait till I've put my
sword down and then I'll give you a display of boxing."
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 33
"Well said," exclaimed Sun Wukong, "spoken like a man. Come on then." The demon king dropped his guard
to throw a punch, and Sun Wukong rushed in towards him, punching and kicking. When he spread out his
hand it was enormous, and when he clenched his fist it was very hard. Sun Wukong hit the demon king in the
ribs, kicked his backside, and smashed several of his joints. The demon king seized his steel sword that was as
big as a plank, and swung it at Sun Wukong's skull. Sun Wukong dodged the blow, and the sword only split
air. Seeing how ugly the demon king had turned, Sun Wukong used his magic art of getting extra bodies. He
pulled out one of his hairs, popped it in his mouth, chewed it up, and blew it out into the air, shouting,
"Change!" It turned into two or three hundred little monkeys, who all crowded round him.
Sun Wukong now had an immortal body, and there was no magic transformation of which he was not capable.
Since he had followed the Way he could change each of the eighty−four thousand hairs on his body into
anything he wanted. The little monkeys were too quick and nimble for sword or spear.
Look at them, leaping forwards and jumping backwards, rushing up and surrounding the demon king,
grabbing him, seizing him, poking him in the backside, pulling at his feet, punching him, kicking him, tearing
his hair out, scratching at his eyes, twisting his nose, all picking him up together and throwing him to the
ground. They went on until they had beaten him to a pulp. Sun Wukong snatched his sword from him, told the
little monkeys to get out of the way, and brought it down on the crown of his head, splitting it into two.
Then he led his forces charging into the cave, where they exterminated all the demons, big and small. He
shook his hair and put it back on his body. The monkeys who did not go back on his body were the little
monkeys the demon king had carried off from the Water Curtain Cave. Sun Wukong asked them how they
had got there.
There were thirty of forty of them, and they replied with tears in their eyes, "It was after Your Majesty went
off to become an Immortal. He has been fighting with us for the last two years. He brought us all here by
force. All the things here−−the stone bowls and plates−−were stolen from our cave by that beast."
"If it's our stuff, take it all out," said Sun Wukong. He then set fire to the Cave in the Belly of the Water and
burnt it to a cinder.
"Come back with me," he ordered the monkeys.
"Your Majesty," they replied, "when we came here all we could hear was the wind howling in our ears as it
blew us here, so we don't know the way. How are we ever going to get back?"
"There's nothing at all to that spell he used," said Sun Wukong. "I can do it too, as now I only have to know
the smallest bit about something to understand it completely. Shut your eyes and don't worry."
Splendid Monkey King. He recited a spell, took them riding on a hurricane, then brought the cloud down to
the ground.
"Open your eyes and look, children," he shouted. As soon as the monkeys' feet touched the ground they
recognized their home. In their delight they all ran along the familiar path to the cave, and the monkeys who
had stayed in the cave all crowded in as well. They divided themselves into age−groups and bowed in homage
to the Monkey King. Wine and food was laid out to celebrate, and they asked him how he had defeated the
demon king and saved their children. When Sun Wukong had told them the whole story the monkeys were
full of admiration.
"Where did you learn such arts, Your Majesty?" they asked insistently.
Journey to the West
Chapter 2 34
"When I left you," Sun Wukong replied, "I followed the waves and the currents, and drifted across the Eastern
Ocean to the Southern Jambu Continent. Here I taught myself to take human form and to wear these clothes
and boots. I swaggered around for eight or nine years, but I never found the Way, so I sailed across the
Western Ocean to the Western Continent of Cattle−gift. After long enquiries I was lucky enough to meet a
venerable Immortal, who taught me the True Result, which makes me as immortal as heaven, and the great
Dharma Gate to eternal youth." The monkeys all congratulated him and exclaimed that his like could not be
found in a billion years.
Sun Wukong laughed and said, "Children, we should congratulate ourselves on having a surname."
"What is Your Majesty's surname?" the monkey masses asked.
"My surname is now Sun, and my Buddhist name is Wukong."
The monkeys all clapped their hands with joy and said, "Your Majesty is Old Sun, and we are Second Sun,
Third Sun, Thin Sun, Little Sun−−a family of Suns, a nation of Suns, a den of Suns." They all offered Old Sun
their respects, with big plates and small bowls of coconut toddy, grape wine, magic flowers, and magic fruit.
The whole household was happy. My word!
By uniting themselves with a single surname
They are waiting to be transferred to the Register of Immortals.
If you don't know how this ended and want to know about the rest of their lives there, then listen to the
explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 3
The Four Seas and Thousand Mountains All Submit
In the Ninth Hell the Tenth Category Is Struck Off the Register
We have related how the Handsome Monkey King returned home in glory, bringing a large sword he had
captured when he killed the Demon King of Confusion. From then on they practiced the military arts every
day. He asked the little monkeys to cut down bamboo to make spears, carve swords out of wood, and learn to
use banners and whistles. They learned to advance and retreat, and build a camp with a stockade round it.
They spent a lot of time playing at this.
Once Sun Wukong was sitting in his seat of meditation when he wondered: "What would happen to us if our
games were taken for the real thing? What if it alarmed some human monarch or gave offence to some king of
birds or beasts? They might say that we were having military training for a rebellion, and attack us with their
armies. You would be no match for them with your bamboo spears and wooden swords. We must have really
sharp swords and halberds. What are we to do about it?"
When the monkeys heard this they all said with alarm, "Your Majesty has great foresight, but there's nowhere
we can get them." When it was the turn of four older monkeys to speak−−two bare−bottomed apes and two
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 35
gibbons−−they came forward and said, "Your Majesty, if you want sharp weapons they can be very easily
obtained."
"How could it be easy?" asked Sun Wukong.
"To the East of our mountain," they replied, "there is a lake some seventy miles wide that is the boundary of
the country of Aolai. That country has a princely capital, and huge numbers of soldiers and civilians live in
the city. It must have workshops for gold, silver, bronze and iron. If you went there, Your Majesty, you could
either buy arms or get them made; then you could train us to use them in the defense of our mountain. This
would give us long−term security." Sun Wukong was delighted with the suggestion.
"Wait here while I go there," he said.
Splendid Monkey King! He leapt on to his somersault cloud, crossed the seventy miles of lake, and saw that
on the other side there was indeed a city wall, a moat, streets, markets, ten thousand houses, a thousand gates,
and people coming and going in the sunlight.
"There must be ready−made weapons here," Sun Wukong thought, "and getting a few by magic would be
much better than buying them." So he made a magic with his fist and said the words of the spell, sucked in
some air from the Southeast, and blew it hard out again. It turned into a terrifying gale carrying sand and
stones with it.
Where the thunderclouds rise the elements are in chaos;
Black fogs thick with dust cloak the earth in darkness.
Boiling rivers and seas terrify the crabs and fish;
As trees are snapped off in mountain forests tigers and wolves flee.
No business is done in any branch of commerce;
And no one is working at any kind of trade.
In the palace the king has gone to his inner quarters;
And the officials in front of the steps have returned to their offices.
The thrones of princes are all blown over;
Towers of five phoenixes are shaken to their foundations.
Where the storm blew, the prince of Aolai fled in terror, and gates and doors were shut in the streets and
markets. Nobody dared to move outside. Sun Wukong landed his cloud and rushed straight through the gates
of the palace to the arsenal and the military stores, opened the doors, and saw countless weapons: swords,
pikes, sabres, halberds, battleaxes, bills, scimitars, maces, tridents, clubs, bows, crossbows, forks, and spears
were all there.
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 36
At the sight of them he said happily, "How many of these could I carry by myself? I'd better use the magic for
dividing up my body."
Splendid Monkey King. He plucked a hair from his body, chewed it up, spat it out, made the magic with his
fist, said the words of the spell, and shouted "Change!" It turned into hundreds and thousands of little
monkeys, who rushed wildly about grabbing weapons. The strong ones took six or seven each and the weaker
ones two or three, and between them they removed the lot. He climbed back up on the clouds, called up a gale
by magic, and took all the little monkeys home with him.
The monkeys big and small of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit were playing outside the gates of the cave
when they heard the wind. At the sight of countless monkey spirits flying through the air they fled and hid. A
moment later the Handsome Monkey King landed his cloud, put away his mists, shook himself, replaced his
hair, and threw all the weapons into a pile beside the mountain.
"Children," he shouted, "come and get your weapons." When the monkey masses looked they saw Sun
Wukong standing by himself on some level ground, and they all rushed over to him to kowtow and asked
what had happened. Sun Wukong told them the whole story of how he had raised the gale and taken the
weapons. After all the monkeys had thanked him they snatched sabres, grabbed swords, seized battleaxes,
fought for pikes, drew bows, stretched crossbows, shouted, yelled, and so amused themselves for the rest of
the day.
The next day they paraded as usual. Sun Wukong assembled all the monkey host, and they numbered over
forty−seven thousand. This had alarmed all the strange beasts of the mountain−−wolves, monsters, tigers,
leopards, deer, muntjacs, river−deer, foxes, wild cats, badgers, raccoons, lions, elephants, horses, orangutans,
bears, stags, wild boar, mountain cattle, antelopes, rhinoceroses, little dogs, huge dogs. The kings of various
kinds of monsters, seventy−two in all, all came to pay homage to the Monkey King. They offered tribute
every year and attended court in each of the four seasons. They also took part in drill and paid their seasonal
grain levies. Everything was so orderly that the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was as secure as an iron bucket
or a wall of bronze. The kings of the monsters sent gongs, drums, coloured flags, helmets, and armour in great
abundance, and every day there were military exercises.
One day, amid all this success, the Handsome Monkey King suddenly said to the other monkeys, "You are
now expert in the bow and crossbow, and highly skilled in other weapons; but this sword of mine is too
clumsy for my liking. What shall I do about it?"
The four veteran monkeys came forward and submitted a suggestion: "Your Majesty is an Immortal, so
mortals' weapons are not good enough for you. We wonder if Your Majesty is able to travel underwater."
"Since hearing the Way," Sun Wukong replied, "I have mastered the seventy−two earthly transformations. My
somersault cloud has outstanding magical powers. I know how to conceal myself and vanish. I can make
spells and end them. I can reach the sky and find my way into the earth. I can travel under the sun or moon
without leaving a shadow or go through metal or stone freely. I can't be drowned by water or burned by fire.
There's nowhere I cannot go."
"If Your Majesty has these magical powers, the stream under our iron bridge leads to the Dragon palace of the
Eastern Sea. If you are willing to go down there, go and find the Dragon King and ask him for whatever
weapon it is you want. Wouldn't that suit you?"
"Wait till I get back," was Sun Wukong's delighted reply.
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 37
Splendid Monkey King. He leapt to the end of the bridge and made a spell with his fist to ward off the water.
Then he dived into the waves and split the waters to make way for himself till he reached the bed of the
Eastern Sea. On his journey he saw a yaksha demon who was patrolling the sea.
The yaksha barred his way and asked, "What sage or divinity are you, pushing the waters aside like that?
Please tell me so that I can make a report and have you properly received."
"I am the Heaven−born Sage Sun Wukong from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and your old Dragon
King's close neighbour. How is it you don't know me?"
When the yaksha heard this he hurried back to the crystal palace and reported, "Your Majesty, Sun Wukong,
the Heaven−born Sage from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit who says he is your neighbour, is coming to
your palace." Ao Guang, the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, leapt to his feet and went out to meet Sun
Wukong with his dragon sons and grandsons, his prawn soldiers, and his crab generals.
"Come in, exalted Immortal," he said, taking Sun Wukong into the palace where they introduced themselves,
seated him in the place of honour, and offered him tea. Then the Dragon King asked him, "Exalted Immortal,
when did you find the Way, and what magic arts did you acquire?"
"After my birth," said Sun Wukong, "I renounced the world and cultivated my conduct, and thus obtained an
immortal and indestructible body. Recently I have trained my sons and grandsons to guard our cave, but
unfortunately I have not yet found my self a weapon. I have long heard that my illustrious neighbour enjoys
the delights of a jade palace with gate−towers of cowry, and I was sure that you must have some magic
weapons to spare, so I have come especially to beg one of you."
Not wishing to refuse this request, the Dragon King sent Commander Perch to fetch a large sword and offer it
to Sun Wukong.
"I don't know how to use a sword," said Sun Wukong, "so could I ask you to give me something else?" The
Old Dragon King then sent Colonel Mackerel and Guard Commander Eel to fetch a nine−pronged spear.
Sun Wukong leapt down from his seat, took it, tried it out, then flung it down, saying, "It's too light, far too
light; and it doesn't suit me. I beg you to give me another."
The Dragon King smiled as he said, "Exalted Immortal, don't you see that this weighs three thousand six
hundred pounds?"
"It doesn't suit me, it doesn't suit me at all," protested Sun Wukong.
The Dragon King, feeling frightened now, ordered Provincial Commander Bream and Garrison Commander
Carp to bring out a patterned heavenly halberd for warding off spells that weighed seven thousand two
hundred pounds.
As soon as he saw it Sun Wukong bounded forward to take it. He tried a few postures and thrusts with it then
stuck it in the ground between them. "Still too light, far too light."
The Dragon King, now really terrified, said, "Exalted Immortal, that halberd is the heaviest weapon in my
palace."
"As the old saying goes," said Sun Wukong with a grin, "'Never think the dragon king has no treasures.' Have
another look, and if you find anything satisfying I'll give you a good price for it."
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 38
"I really have nothing else," the Dragon King replied.
As he was speaking, his dragon wife and dragon daughters came in from the back of the palace and said,
"Your Majesty, by the look of him this sage must be really somebody. The piece of miraculous iron that
anchors the Milkey Way in place has been shining with a lovely rosy glow for the last few days, and creating
a most auspicious atmosphere. Perhaps it has started to shine to greet this sage."
"That piece of miraculous iron is one of the nails that Yu the Great used to fix the depths of rivers and seas
when he brought the waters under control," said the Dragon King. "What use could it be?"
"Never mind whether it's useful or not," his wife replied. "Just give it to him and let him do with it as he
pleases. At least you'll get him out of the palace."
The Dragon King did as she suggested and described the piece of iron to Sun Wukong, who said, "Bring it out
and let me see."
"It can't be moved. You will have to go and look at it yourself, exalted Immortal."
"Where is it? Take me there," said Sun Wukong.
The Dragon King took him into the middle of the sea treasury, where all of a sudden they could see ten
thousand rays of golden light. Pointing at it, the Dragon King said, "That's it, where all the light is coming
from."
Sun Wukong hitched up his clothes and went to give it a feel. He found that it was an iron pillar about as thick
as a measure for a peck of grain and some twenty feet long. Seizing it with both hands he said, "It's too thick
and too long. If it were a bit shorter and thinner it would do." As soon as these words were out of his mouth
this precious piece of iron became several feet shorter and a few inches thinner.
Sun Wukong tossed it in his hands, remarking that it would be even better if it were thinner still. The precious
iron thereupon became even thinner. Sun Wukong was taking it out of the sea treasury to have a look at it
when he saw that it had two gold bands round it, while the middle part was made of black iron. There was a
line of inlaid writing near the bands which said that it was the AS−YOU−WILL COLD−BANDED CUDGEL:
WEIGHT 13,500 POUNDS.
Sun Wukong was delighted, though he did not show it. "I think that this little darling will do whatever I
want." As he walked along he weighed it in his hand and said reflectively, "If it were even smaller still it
would be perfect." By the time he had taken it outside it was twenty feet long and as thick as a rice bowl.
Watch him as he uses his magical powers to try a few routines with it, whirling all round the crystal palace.
The Old Dragon King was trembling with fright, and the little dragons were scared out of their wits.
Terrapins, freshwater turtles, seawater turtles and alligators drew in their heads, while fish, shrimps, lobsters
and giant turtles hid their faces.
Holding his treasure in his hands, Sun Wukong sat down in the main hall of the palace of crystal and said with
a smile to the Dragon King, "Many thanks, worthy neighbour, for your great generosity."
The Old Dragon King humbly acknowledged his thanks, and Sun Wukong went on, "This piece of iron will
be very useful, but there is one more thing I want to ask."
"What might that be, exalted Immortal?" asked the Dragon King.
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 39
"If I hadn't got this cudgel, that would be the end of the matter, but as I have got it the problem is that I don't
have−the clothes to go with it. What are we to do about it? If you have any armour here, I'd be most obliged if
you gave me a suit." The Dragon King said he had not any.
"'A guest should not have to trouble two hosts,'" said Sun Wukong. "I won't leave without one."
"Please try some other sea, exalted Immortal−−you may find one there."
"'It's better to stay in one house than to visit three.' I beg and implore you to give me a suit."
"I really don't have one," replied the Dragon King. "If I had I would present it to you."
"If you really haven't, then I'll try this cudgel out on you."
"Don't hit me, exalted Immortal, don't hit me," pleaded the Dragon King in terror. "Let me see whether my
brothers have one that they could give you."
"Where do your brothers live?"
"They are Ao Qin, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea, Ao Shun, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea, and
Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea."
"I'm damned if I'm going there: as the saying goes, 'Two in the pocket is better than three owing.' So be a
good chap and give me one."
"There is no need for you to go, lofty Immortal," the Dragon King replied, "I have an iron drum and a bronze
bell. In an emergency we strike them to bring my brothers here in an instant."
"In that case," said Sun Wukong, "hurry up and sound them." And indeed an alligator general struck the bell
while a terrapin marshal beat the drum. The sound of the bell and the drum startled the other three dragon
kings, who had arrived and were waiting together outside within the instant.
One of them, Ao Qin, said, "Elder Brother, what's up? Why the drum and the bell?"
"It hurts me to tell you, brother," the Old Dragon King replied. "There's this so−called heaven−born sage from
the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit who came here this morning saying that I was his neighbour, then
demanded a weapon. I offered him a steel−pronged spear but he said it was too small, and a patterned halberd
that he said was too light. Then he picked up the miraculous iron that fastens the Milky Way and tried a few
movements with it. Now he's sitting in the palace and demanding a suit of armour, but we haven't got one.
That's why I used the bell and the drum to call you here. You three must have some armour. Please give him a
suit, then we can get rid of him."
When Ao Qin heard this he said in a fury, "To arms, brothers. Arrest the criminal."
"No! No! It's out of the question," said the Old Dragon King. "If that iron cudgel of his gets you you're done
for, if it hits you die, if it comes close your skin is broken, and if it so much as brushes against you your
sinews are smashed."
Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, said, "Second brother, you must not attack him. Instead we
should put a suit of armour together for him, then send him away. We can send a memorial about it to Heaven,
then Heaven will of course punish him."
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 40
"You're right," said Ao Shun, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea. "I have a pair of lotus−root
cloud−walking shoes."
"I've brought a suit of golden chain mail," said Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea.
"And I have a phoenix−winged purple gold helmet," added Ao Qin, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea. The
Old Dragon King was very pleased, and he brought them into the palace to meet Sun Wukong and present the
equipment to him.
Sun Wukong put on the golden helmet and the armour and the cloud−walking shoes, then charged out, waving
his cudgel and saying to the dragons, "My apologies for disturbing you." The four Dragon Kings were most
indignant, but we will not go into their discussions on the protest they sent to Heaven.
Watch the Monkey King as he parts the waters and goes straight back to the iron bridge, where the four senior
apes can be seen waiting for him at the head of the monkey host. Sun Wukong suddenly leapt out of the waves
without a drop of water on him and gleaming with gold.
As he came across the bridge the monkeys were so astonished that they fell to their knees and said, "How
splendid you look, Your Majesty, how splendid." Sun Wukong, his face lit up with youthful vigor, climbed up
to his throne, thrust his cudgel into the ground in their midst. The foolish monkeys all tried to grab this
treasure, but it was as futile as a dragonfly trying to shake an iron tree: they were unable to move it in the
slightest.
Biting their fingers and sticking out their tongues they said, "Grandpa, it's so heavy, how can you possibly lift
it?"
Sun Wukong went over, lifted it with one hand, and laughed as he said to them, "Everything has its rightful
owner. This little treasure has been lying in the sea treasury for goodness knows how many thousands of
years, but it just happened to start shining this year. The Dragon King thought it was just a piece of ordinary
iron, and said it was the miraculous treasure that holds the bed of the Milky Way in place. None of his men
could move it, so he had to ask me to go and fetch it myself. It was more than twenty feet long then, and as
thick as a peck−measure. When I picked it up I felt that it was too big, and it shrank till it was several times as
small. I told it to get even smaller, and it did that too; then I told it to get smaller still, and it got many times
smaller again. I hurried out into the light of day to look at it, and I saw that there was an inscription on it that
read 'AS−YOU−WILL GOLD−BANDED CUDGEL: WEIGHT 13,500 POUNDS'. Stand aside, and I'll make
it change again."
Holding his treasure in his hand he said, "Shrink, shrink, shrink," and it became as small as an embroidery
needle, tiny enough to be hidden in his ear.
"Your Majesty," the monkeys cried out in astonishment, "bring it out and play with it again."
So the Monkey King brought it out of his ear again, laid it on the palm of his hand, and said, "Grow, grow,
grow." It became as thick as a peck again and twenty feet long. Now that he was really enjoying himself he
bounded over the bridge and went out of the cave. Clasping his treasure he used some of his heaven and earth
magic, bowed, and shouted, "Grow."
He became a hundred thousand feet tall; his head was as big as a mountain, his waist like a range of hills, his
eyes flashed like lightning, his mouth seemed to be a bowl of blood, and his teeth were as swords and
halberds; the cudgel in his hands reached up to the Thirty−third Heaven and down to the Eighteenth Hell. The
tigers, leopards and wolves, the beasts of the mountain, and the seventy−two monster kings all kowtowed and
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 41
bowed in terror, trembling so much that they went out of their minds. A moment later he reverted to his proper
size, turned his treasure into an embroidery needle, hid it in his ear, and went back to the cave. The
panic−stricken kings of the monsters all came to offer their congratulations.
There was a great display of banners and drums, and the air resounded to the sound of gongs and bells. Rare
delicacies were set out in great quantities, cups brimmed with coconut toddy and the wine of the grape, and
the Monkey King feasted and drank with his people for a long time. Then training went on as before.
The Monkey King named the four senior apes as his four Stalwart Generals: he named the two bare−bottomed
apes Marshal Ma and Marshal Liu, and called the two gibbons General Beng and General Ba. He entrusted the
stockade, questions of discipline and rewards to these four. Thus freed from cares, he mounted the clouds and
rode the mists, wandering round the four seas and enjoying the thousand mountains. He practiced his martial
arts, visited many a hero, used his magical powers, and made a wide and distinguished circle of friends. He
met with six sworn brothers of his: the Bull Demon King, the Salamander Demon King, the Roc Demon King,
the Camel King, the Macaque King, and the Lion King. With him included they made seven. For days on end
they talked about politics and war, passed round the goblet, strummed, sang, piped, danced, went off on days
out together, and enjoyed themselves in every possible way. A journey of thousands of miles seemed to them
to be no more than a walk in the courtyard. It could be said that they traveled a thousand miles in the time it
takes to nod one's head, and covered three hundred with a twist of the waist.
One day he instructed his four Stalwart Generals to arrange a feast for the six other kings. Oxen and horses
were slaughtered, sacrifices were made to Heaven and Earth, and the assembled monsters danced, sang, and
drank themselves blotto. When he had seen the six kings out and tipped his senior and junior officials Sun
Wukong lay himself down under the shade of the pines beside the bridge and was asleep in an instant. The
four Stalwart Generals made the others stand round and guard him, and they all kept their voices down.
In his sleep the Handsome Monkey King saw two men approach him with a piece of paper in their hands on
which was written "Sun Wukong." Without allowing any explanations they tied up his soul and dragged it
staggering along till they reached a city wall. The Monkey King, who was gradually recovering from his
drunken stupor, looked up and saw an iron plate on the wall on which was inscribed WORLD OF
DARKNESS in large letters.
In a flash of realization he said, "The World of Darkness is where King Yama lives. Why have I come here?"
"Your life in the world above is due to end now," his escorts said, "and we were ordered to fetch you."
To this the Monkey King replied, "I have gone beyond the Three Worlds, and I am no longer subject to the
Five Elements. I don't come under King Yama's jurisdiction. How dare you grab me, you idiots?" But the
fetchers of the dead just went on tugging at him, determined to drag him inside.
The Monkey King lost his temper, pulled his treasure out of his ear, and gave it a shake. It became as thick as
a rice bowl. It only took a slight movement of his arm to smash the two fetchers of the dead to pulp. He untied
his bonds, loosed his hands, and charged into the city whirling his cudgel, so terrifying the ox−headed and
horse−faced devils that they fled in all directions for cover.
All the devil soldiers rushed to the Senluo Palace and reported, "Your Majesty, disaster, disaster! A
hairy−faced thunder−god is attacking us out there."
Stricken by panic, the Ten Kings who sit in the ten palaces, judging the criminal cases of the dead, hurriedly
straightened their clothing and went out to look. When they saw his ferocious expression they lined up in
order and shouted at the tops of their voices, "Please tell us your name, exalted Immortal."
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 42
"If you don't know who I am," replied the Monkey King, "then why did you send men to bring me here?"
"We wouldn't dare do such a thing. The messengers must have made a mistake."
"I am Sun Wukong, the Heaven−born sage of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.
What are your posts?"
"We are the ten kings."
"Tell me your names at once if you don't want a bashing."
To this the ten kings replied, "We are the King of Qinguang, the King of Chujiang, King Songdi, King
Wuguan, King Yama, King Impartial, the King of Mount Tai, the Metropolitan King, the King of Biancheng,
and the King of the Ever−turning Wheel."
To this Sun Wukong replied, "You are all kings, and have esoteric understanding, so why don't you know any
better? I, Sun Wukong, have cultivated the Way of Immortality and will live as long as Heaven. I've soared
beyond the Three Worlds and leapt outside the Five Elements, so why did you send your men to get me?"
"Please don't be angry, lofty Immortal," the ten kings said. "Many people in the world share the same name,
so perhaps the fetchers of the dead went to the wrong place."
"Nonsense, nonsense. As the saying goes, 'The magistrate may be wrong and the sergeant may be wrong, but
the man who comes to get you is never wrong.' Go and get the Register of Life and Death for me to see." The
Ten Kings invited him to come into the palace and look through it.
Sun Wukong went into the Senluo Palace with his club in his hand, and sat down in the middle of the hall
facing South. The Ten Kings then ordered the presiding judge to fetch the register, and the judge hastened to
his office and brought out five or six documents and ten registers. He looked through them all one by one, but
could not find Sun Wukong's name in the sections devoted to hairless creatures, hairy creatures, feathered
creatures, insects, or scaly creatures. Then he looked through the monkey section. Now although monkeys
looked like men, they were not entered under the humans; although they were like the hairless creatures, they
did not live within their boundaries; although they were like running animals, they were not under the
jurisdiction of the unicorn; and although they were like birds, they were not ruled by the phoenix. There was
another register, and Sun Wukong looked through this one himself. Under "Soul No. 1350" was the name of
Sun Wukong, the Heaven−born stone monkey, who was destined to live to the age of 342 and die a good
death.
"I won't write down any number of years," said Sun Wukong. "I'll just erase my name and be done with it.
Bring me a brush." The judge hastily handed him a brush and thick, black ink.
Sun Wukong took the register, crossed out all the names in the monkey section, and threw it on the floor with
the words, "The account's closed. That's an end of it. We won't come under your control any longer." Then he
cudgeled his way out of the World of Darkness. The Ten Kings dared not go near him, and they all went to the
Azure Cloud Palace to bow in homage to the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha and discuss the report they would send
up to Heaven. But we will not go into this.
After charging out through the city wall the Monkey King tripped over a clump of grass, tried to regain his
balance, and woke up with a start. It had all been a dream. As he stretched himself he heard his four Stalwart
Generals and the other monkeys saying, "Your Majesty, time to wake up. You drank too much and slept all
night."
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 43
"Never mind about my sleeping. I dreamt that two men came for me. They dragged me to the city−wall of the
World of Darkness, where I came round. I showed them my magic powers and went yelling all the way to the
Senluo Palace, where I had an argument with those Ten Kings and looked through the Register of Life and
Death of us. Wherever there was mention of your names in the register, I crossed them out. We won't come
under the jurisdiction of those idiots any more."
All the monkeys kowtowed to him in gratitude. The reason why from that time on so many mountain
monkeys have never grown old is that their names are not on the books of the officials of the Underworld.
When the Handsome Monkey King had finished telling his story, the four Stalwart Generals informed the
other monster kings, who all came to offer their felicitations. A few days later his six sworn brothers also
came to congratulate him, and all were delighted to hear how he had struck the names off the books. We will
not describe the daily feasts that followed.
Instead we will describe how one day the Supreme Heavenly Sage, the Greatly Compassionate Jade Emperor
of the Azure Vault of Heaven, was sitting on his throne in the Hall of Miraculous Mist in the Golden−gated
Cloud Palace, surrounded by his immortal civil and military officials at morning court, when the Immortal
Qiu Hongji reported, "Your Majesty, Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, has presented a
memorial outside the Hall of Universal Brightness, and is awaiting a summons from your Imperial Majesty."
The Jade Emperor ordered that he be called in, and the Dragon King came to the Hall of Miraculous Mist.
When he had done obeisance an immortal page came from the side to take his memorial. The Jade Emperor
read it through. It ran:
Your Subject Ao Guang,
the Humble Dragon of the Eastern Sea of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body in the Nether Watery
Regions
Reports to the Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven
Recently one Sun Wukong, an immortal fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit now living in the
Water Curtain Cave, bullied this humble dragon and occupied my watery house by force. He demanded a
weapon by displaying magical prowess; he insisted on having armour by showing off his evil powers. He
terrified the watery tribe and made the tortoises and alligators flee in terror. The dragon of the Southern Sea
trembled, the dragon of the Western Sea was made miserable, the dragon of the Northern Sea had to hang his
head and come in submission, and I, your subject Ao Guang, humbled myself before him. We had to present
him with a miraculous iron cudgel, a golden phoenix−winged helmet, a suit of chain mail, and a pair of
cloud−walking shoes; and we escorted him out politely.
He continued to show off his martial arts and magic powers, and all he had to say for himself was, "My
apologies for disturbing you." There is truly no match for him, and he is uncontrollable. Your subject now
presents this memorial, and respectfully awaits your sage decision. I humbly beg that heavenly soldiers be
sent to arrest this evil demon, so that the sea and the mountains may be at peace, and the ocean may enjoy
tranquillity.
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 44
When the Jade Emperor had read this through he ordered, "Let the Dragon God return to the Sea; we shall
send generals to arrest the demon." The Old Dragon King bowed till his head touched the floor and took his
leave.
Then the Venerable Immortal Ge, a heavenly teacher, reported, "Your Majesty, the King of Qinguang, one of
the ministers of the Underworld, has come with a memorial from the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha." A jade girl
messenger took the memorial, which the Jade Emperor read through. It ran:
The regions of darkness are the negative part of the Earth. Heaven contains gods while the Earth has devils;
Positive and Negative are in a constant cycle. Birds and beasts are born and die; male and female alternate.
Life is created and change takes place; male and female are conceived and born; this is the order of nature,
and it cannot be changed. Now the evil spirit, the Heaven−born monkey of the Water Curtain Cave on the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, is presently giving full rein to his wicked nature, committing murders, and
refusing to submit to discipline. He killed the devil messengers of the Ninth Hell with his magic, and he
terrified the Ten Benevolent Kings of the Underworld with his power. He made an uproar in the Senluo
Palace and crossed some names out by force. He has made the race of monkeys completely uncontrollable,
and given eternal life to the macaques. He has annulled the law of transmigration and brought them beyond
birth and death. I, impoverished monk that I am, importune the might of Heaven by presenting this memorial.
I prostrate myself to beg that Heavenly soldiers be despatched to subdue this fiend, bring the positive and
Negative back into order, and give lasting security to the Underworld.
When the Jade Emperor had read this through he ordered, "Let the Lord of Darkness return to the
Underworld. We shall send generals to arrest the demon." The King of Qinguang then bowed till his head
touched the floor and took his leave.
His Celestial Majesty then asked all his civil and military officials, "When was this monkey demon born?
What is his origin, that he should have such powers?"
Before he had finished speaking, Thousand−mile Eye and Wind−accompanying Ear came forward from the
ranks of officials and said, "This demon monkey is the stone monkey who was born of heaven three hundred
years ago. At the time nobody paid any attention to him, and we do not know where he refined himself and
became an Immortal in recent years, so that he has been able to make the tigers and dragons submit to him and
to strike his name off the register of the dead."
"Which divine general shall be sent down to capture him?" asked the Jade Emperor, and before he had
finished speaking the Great White Planet stepped forward, bowed down, and submitted, "All beings in the
upper worlds that have nine apertures can become Immortals. This monkey has a body that was created by
Heaven and Earth and conceived by the sun and moon. His head touches they sky and his feet stand on the
earth; he drinks the dew and eats the mist. How does he differ from humans, if he has succeeded in cultivating
the way of immortality and can subdue dragons and tigers? I beg Your Majesty to remember your life−giving
mercy and hand down a sage edict of amnesty and enlistment, summoning him to this upper world and
inscribing his name on the list of officeholders, thus keeping him here under control. If he obeys Your
Majesty's heavenly commands, he can later be promoted; and if he disobeys, he can be arrested. This will both
avoid military operations and be a way of winning over an Immortal."
The Jade Emperor, delighted with the suggestion, ordered that it should be put into effect. He told the Wenqu
Star Officer to compose the edict, and commanded the Great White planet to persuade the monkey to accept
Journey to the West
Chapter 3 45
the amnesty.
The Great White Planet left Heaven by the Southern Gate, and brought his propitious cloud down by the
Water Curtain Cave, where he said to the little monkeys, "I am an envoy from Heaven, and I am carrying a
divine edict inviting your great king to the upper world. Go and tell him at once."
The little monkeys outside conveyed the message by relays into the depths of the cave: "Your Majesty, there's
an old man outside carrying a document on his back. He says he's an envoy from Heaven with an invitation
for you." The Handsome Monkey King was delighted.
He said, "I'd been thinking of going up to Heaven to have a look round for the past couple of days, and now a
heavenly envoy has come to invite me."
"Ask him in at once," he shouted, hastily straightening his clothes and going out to meet the envoy.
The Planet came straight in, stood facing the South, and said, "I am the Great White Planet of the West, and I
have come down to earth with an Edict of Amnesty and enlistment from the Jade Emperor to invite you to
Heaven to be given office as an Immortal."
"I am very grateful to you, venerable Planet, for condescending to come here," replied Sun Wukong with a
smile; then he told his subjects to prepare a feast to entertain the visitor.
"I'm afraid I can't delay," replied the Planet, "as I am carrying a divine edict, so may I ask Your Majesty to
come back with me now? We can talk at leisure after your glorious elevation."
"Thank you for coming," said Sun Wukong. "I'm sorry you couldn't take some refreshments before leaving."
Then he called for his four Stalwart Generals and ordered them, "Give my sons and grandsons a thorough
training. When I've had a look round in Heaven, I'll take you all to live with me up there." The four Stalwart
Generals accepted their orders, and the Monkey King made his cloud carry him up above the clouds. He was
Raised to a high−ranking heavenly office,
Listed among the courtiers in the clouds.
If you don't know what office he was given, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 4
Dissatisfied at Being Appointed Protector of the Horses
Not Content with the Title of Equal of Heaven
The Great White Planet left the depths of the cave with the Handsome Monkey King, and they ascended
together on their clouds. As Sun Wukong's somersault cloud was exceptionally fast he reached the Southern
Gate of Heaven first, leaving the Great White planet far behind. Just as he was putting away his cloud to go in,
his way was barred by the Heavenly Guardian Virudhaka and his powerful heavenly soldiers Liu, Gou, Bi,
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 46
Deng, Xin, Zhang, and Tao, who blocked the gate of Heaven with their spears and swords and refused to let
him in.
"This old Great White planet is a trickster," said Sun Wukong. "He invited me here, so he has no business to
have me kept out with spears and swords." Just as he was kicking up a row the Planet suddenly arrived.
Sun Wukong flung his accusation at him: "Why did you play this trick on me, you old fogy? You told me you
came with an Edict of Amnesty from the Jade Emperor to invite me here, so why did you arrange for these
people not to let me in through the gate of Heaven?" The Great White Planet laughed.
"Don't be angry, Your Majesty. You've never been here before, your name is not on the books here, and the
heavenly soldiers have never met you. Of course they could not let you in just for the asking. But when you've
seen His Celestial Majesty and been given office among the Immortals, you will be able to come and go as
you wish, and nobody will try to stop you."
"Be that as it may," said Sun Wukong, "I'm not going in." The Great White Planet would not let him go and
asked him to go in with him in spite of it all.
As they approached the gate, the Planet shouted, "Heavenly officers of the gates of Heaven, sergeants and
soldiers, let us in. This is an Immortal from the lower world, and I am carrying an edict from the Jade
Emperor summoning him here." Only then did the Heavenly King Zengzhang and his soldiers withdraw their
arms and stand back. Now the Monkey King began to trust the Great White Planet. He walked slowly in with
him and looked at the view. Truly it was his
First ascent to the upper world,
Sudden entry into paradise.
Ten thousand beams of golden light shone with a reddish glow;
A thousand strands of propitious vapour puffed out purple mist.
See the Southern Gate of Heaven,
Deep green,
Crystalline,
Shimmering bright,
Studded with jewels.
On either side stood scores of heavenly marshals,
Tall as the roofbeams, next to the pillars,
Holding metal−tipped bows and banners.
All around stood gods in golden armour,
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 47
Brandishing their clubs and halberds,
Wielding their cutlasses and swords.
The outside was remarkable enough,
But the inside astonished him.
Here were several mighty pillars,
Round which coiled tawny−bearded dragons, their gold scales gleaming in the sun.
There were long bridges,
Where strutted phoenixes, brilliant of plumage and with bright red crests.
A rosy glow shone with heavenly light;
Thick green mists obscured the Pole Star.
In this heaven there are thirty−three heavenly palaces:
The Palace of Clouds Dispersed, the Vaisravana Palace, the palace of
Five Lores, the Sun Palace, the Palace of Flowery Bliss,
Every palace had golden animals on its roof.
Then there were seventy−two precious halls:
The Hall of Morning Audience, the Hall of Rising into Space, the Precious Light Hall, the Hall of the
Heavenly Kings, the Hall of the Master of Miracles,
Jade unicorns on every column.
On the Terrace of the Star of Longevity
Grew flowers that never wither.
Beside the Stove for Decocting Elixir,
Were herbs that stay green for ever.
In front of the Facing the Sage pavilion
Crimson gauze clothes Glittered like stars;
Lotus hats
Shone with gold and jade.
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 48
Jade hairpins and pearl−sewn shoes,
Golden seals on purple cords.
As the golden bell tolled,
The three classes of divinities approached the steps and submitted memorials.
As the heavenly drum was beaten,
Ten thousand sage kings attended the Jade Emperor.
Then they entered the Hall of Miraculous Mist,
Where jade doors were studded with gold,
And phoenixes danced before the crimson gates.
Winding arcades,
Everywhere carved in openwork;
Layer on Layer of eaves,
With dragons and phoenixes soaring.
On top was a majestically purple,
Bright,
Perfectly round,
And dazzling
Golden gourd−shaped finial;
Below, fans hung from the hands of heavenly consorts,
While jade maidens proffered magic clothes.
Ferocious
The heavenly generals guarding the court;
Majestic
The immortal officials protecting the throne.
In the middle were set Crystal dishes
Filled to overflowing with Great Monad Pills;
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 49
Agate jars
In which stood twisted coral trees.
All the wonderful things in Heaven were there,
None of which are seen on Earth:
Golden gates, silver chariots, and a purple palace;
Precious plants, jade flowers, and jasper petals.
The jade hares of the princes at court ran past the alter;
The golden rooks of the sages present flew down low.
The Monkey King was fated to come to Heaven,
Rather than be sullied by the mortal world.
The Great White Planet led the Handsome Monkey King to the outside of the Hall of Miraculous Mist. He
went straight in to the imperial presence without waiting to be summoned, and did obeisance to the throne.
Sun Wukong stood bolt upright beside him, not bothering with any court etiquette, but just concentrating on
listening to the Great White Planet make his report to the Jade Emperor: "In obedience to the Divine Edict,
your subject has brought the demon Immortal here."
The Jade Emperor lowered his curtain and asked, "And which of you is the demon Immortal?"
"Me," replied Sun Wukong, only now making a slight bow.
The faces of the officials went white with horror as they exclaimed, "What a savage monkey! He has the
impudence to answer 'Me,' and without even prostrating himself first! He must die!"
In reply to this the Jade Emperor announced, "Sun Wukong is a demon Immortal of the lower world who has
only just obtained human form, so he is not acquainted with court procedure. We shall forgive him this time."
"We thank you for your mercy," said the immortal ministers. Only then did Sun Wukong express his respect
by bowing low and chanting "na−a−aw" at the top of his voice. The Jade Emperor ordered his immortal civil
and military officials to find a vacancy in some department for Sun Wukong.
The Star Lord Wuqu stepped forward form the side and reported, "There are no vacancies in any of the
palaces, halls, and departments of Heaven except for a superintendent in the Imperial Stables."
"Then make him Protector of the Horses," ordered the Jade Emperor. All the ministers thanked him for his
mercy, apart from Sun Wukong, who just expressed his respect with a loud "na−a−aw." The Jade Emperor
then told the Wood Planet to take him to the Imperial Stables.
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 50
The Wood Planet accompanied the delighted Monkey King to his post and then went back to the palace. The
Monkey King then called together the deputy and the assistant superintendent, the book−keeper, the grooms,
and all the other officials, high and low, to find out about the duties of his department. He found that he had to
look after a thousand heavenly horses:
Chestnuts and stallions,
Courser and chargers:
Dragon and Purple Swallow,
Pegasus and Sushun,
Jueti and Silver,
Yaoniao and Flying Yellow,
Taotu and Feathers,
Red Hare and Faster Than Light,
Dazzler and Horizon,
Mist−soarer and Victory;
Wind−chaser and Matchless,

Neighing in the wind, chasing the lightning, mighty in spirit;
Pawing the mist, climbing the clouds, great in their strength.
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 51
The Monkey King looked through the register and counted the horses. In the stables the book−keeper was
responsible for ordering the fodder, the head groom was in charge of currying the horses, chopping up and
cooking the fodder, and giving them water; the deputy superintendent and his assistant helped to oversee the
work. The Protector of the Horses looked after his charges, sleeping neither by day nor by night. It is true that
he fooled around by day, but at night he looked after the animals with great diligence, waking them up and
making them eat whenever they fell asleep, and leading those still on their feet to the trough. At the sight of
him the heavenly horses would prick up their ears and paw the ground, and they became fat and plump. Thus
more than half a month slipped by.
On one morning that was a holiday all the officials of the stables held a feast both to welcome and
congratulate the Protector of the Horses.
In the middle of the party the Monkey King suddenly put down his cup and asked, "What sort of office is this
'Protector of the Horses?'"
"What the name suggests, that's all."
"Which official grading does it carry?"
"Unclassified."
"What does 'unclassified' mean?"
"Bottom grade," the others replied, going on to explain, "It is a very low and unimportant office, and all you
can do in it is look after the horses. Even someone who works as conscientiously as Your Honour and gets the
horses so fat will get no more reward than someone saying 'good'; and if anything goes at all wrong you will
be held responsible, and if the losses are serious you will be fined and punished."
The Monkey King flared up on hearing this, gnashed his teeth, and said in a great rage, "How dare they treat
me with such contempt? On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I am a king and a patriarch. How dare he trick
me into coming here to feed his horses for him? It's a low job for youngsters, not for me. I won't do it, I won't.
I'm going back." He pushed the table over with a crash, took his treasure out of his ear, and shook it. It
became as thick as a rice bowl, and he brandished it as he charged out of the Imperial Stables to the Southern
Gate of Heaven. As the celestial guards knew that his name was on the register of immortal officials they did
not dare to block his path, but let him out through the gate.
He descended by cloud and was back on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in an instant. Seeing the four
Stalwart Generals and all the kings of the monsters drilling their troops there he shouted in a shrill voice,
"Children, I'm back." The monkeys all bowed to him, took him into the heart of the cave, and asked him to sit
on his throne, while they prepared a banquet to welcome him back.
"Congratulations, Your Majesty," they all said. "After over a dozen years up there you must be coming back
in glory and triumph."
"What do you mean, over a dozen years?" asked the Monkey King. "I've only been away for a fortnight or
so."
"Your Majesty can't have noticed the time passing in heaven. A day in heaven lasts as long as a year on earth.
May we ask what office you held?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 52
"It hurts me to tell you," replied the Monkey King with a wave of his hand. "I feel thoroughly humiliated.
That Jade Emperor doesn't know how to use a good man. A man like me−−'Protector of the Horses'. That
meant I had to feed his animals for him and wasn't even given an official grading. I didn't know this at first, so
I fooled around in the Imperial Stables until today, when I found out from my colleagues how low the job
was. I was so angry that I pushed the table over and quit the job. That's why I've come back."
"Quite right too," the other monkeys said. "Your Majesty can be king in our cave paradise and enjoy as much
honour and pleasure as you like, so why go and be his groom?" Then they gave orders for wine to be brought
at once to cheer their king up.
As they were drinking someone came in to report, "Your Majesty, there are two Single−horned Devil Kings
outside who want to see you."
"Ask them in," said the Monkey King, and the two formally−dressed devil kings hurried into the cave and
prostrated themselves.
"Why have you come to see me?" asked the Handsome Monkey King; and they replied, "We have long heard
that Your Majesty is looking for men of talent, but we were unable to see you before. Now that Your Majesty
has been given heavenly office and come back in triumph, we would like to offer you this yellow robe as a
token of our congratulations. We also hope that you will not reject us although we are low and worthless, but
will accept our humble services." An exultant Monkey King put on the yellow robe and his happy subjects
bowed to him in order of precedence. The two devil kings were appointed Commanders of the Van, and when
they had thanked the Monkey King for this they asked, "What office did Your Majesty hold while you were
all that time in Heaven?"
"The Jade Emperor has no respect for talent," replied the Monkey King. "He made me something called
'Protector of the Horses.'"
"Your Majesty has such miraculous powers: you should never have been feeding his horses for him. You
should have been made a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' shouldn't you?" The Monkey King was beside
himself with delight at this suggestion, and he kept saying how splendid it was.
"Get me a banner made at once with the words 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven' in big letters on it, and put up a
pole to hang it from," he ordered his four Stalwart Generals. "From now on I am to be called 'Great Sage
Equaling Heaven,' not 'Your Majesty' or 'King'. Pass this order on to all the other kings of the monsters." We
will leave him at this point.
When the Jade Emperor held his morning court the next day the Heavenly Teacher Zhang led the deputy and
assistant superintendents of the Imperial Stables to the vermilion steps, bowed low, and reported, "Your
Majesty, Sun Wukong, the new Protector of the Horses, left Heaven yesterday because he thought his office
was too humble."
Just as he was speaking the Heavenly Guardian Virudhaka came from the Southern Gate of Heaven with his
heavenly soldiers and reported, "The Protector of the Horses has gone out through the gate. We do not know
why."
On hearing this the Jade Emperor commanded, "Let the two divine officials return to their posts; we shall send
heavenly soldiers to capture this devil."
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 53
The pagoda−bearing Heavenly King Li Jing and Prince Nezha stepped forward from the ranks of those
attending the audience, and they memorialized, "Your Imperial Majesty, we beg you to command us, your
incompetent servants, to subdue this fiend." The Emperor was delighted with this suggestion, and he
appointed the Pagoda−bearing Heavenly King as Demon quelling High Marshal, and Prince Nezha as Great
God of the Seas. He told them to take their forces down to the lower world at once.
Heavenly King Li and Nezha kowtowed, took their leave, went straight back to their own palace, and
assembled their troops, commanders and officers. They put the Mighty Miracle God in charge of the
vanguard, and General Fishbelly in command of the rear, while General Yaksa was made adjutant. Within an
instant they were outside the Southern Gate of Heaven, and they went straight to the Mountain of Flowers and
Fruit. They chose a piece of level and open ground on which to construct a fortified camp, and ordered the
Mighty Miracle God to issue the challenge to battle. On receiving this order the Mighty Miracle God tied on
his armour firmly and went to the Water Curtain Cave, holding his flower−spreading battle−axe. When he got
there he saw huge numbers of devils−−wolves, tigers and leopards−−wielding spears, brandishing swords,
leaping around, fighting each other, and making a great noise outside the little entrance to the cave.
"Accursed beasts," shouted the Mighty Miracle God, "tell the Protector of the Horses at once that I am a
heavenly general come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue him. If you make him come out and
surrender immediately it will save the lot of you from being wiped out."
The devils went rushing into the cave and reported, "Disaster, disaster."
"What disaster?" the Monkey King asked.
"There's a heavenly general outside who says he's come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue you. If
you go out and surrender immediately, he says he'll spare our lives."
"Fetch me my armour," said the Monkey King. He then donned his golden helmet, tied on his golden armour,
put on his cloud−walking shoes, and took his As−You−Will gold−banded cudgel in his hand. He led his
troops out of the cave and drew them up in battle array. The Mighty Miracle God gazed wide−eyed at the
excellent Monkey King:
On his body was gleaming golden armour,
On his head a dazzling golden helmet,
In his hand a gold−banded club,
On his feet a pair of cloud−walking shoes to match.
His devil eyes shone like stars,
His ears were long and hard.
His sturdy frame could be transformed at will,
His voice rang clearly as a bell.
The sharp−mouthed Horse Protector with protruding teeth

Chapter 4 54
Wanted to become a Sage Equaling Heaven.
The Mighty Miracle God shouted in a harsh voice, "Insolent ape! Don't you recognize me?"
The Great Sage Sun Wukong replied at once, "I've never met you before. How should I know which wretched
little deity you are? Tell me your name at once."
"I'll get you, you conceited baboon. So you don't know who I am? I am the Heavenly General Mighty Miracle,
the commander of the vanguard for Heavenly King Li, the Pagoda−bearer. I have come here on the orders of
the Jade Emperor to accept your surrender. Take off your armour at once and submit to the mercy of Heaven,
or I'll wipe out every animal on the mountain. And if you so much as hint at a refusal, I'll smash you to
powder."
"Stop talking so big, you lousy god," retorted the furious Monkey King, "and give that long tongue of yours a
rest. I'd just love to kill you with this cudgel of mine, but if I did there'd be no one to deliver my message for
me, so I'll spare your life. Hurry back to Heaven and tell that Jade Emperor that he doesn't know how to use a
good man. Why did he make me waste my infinite powers on feeding his horses for him? Take a look at
what's written on my standard. If he's willing to give me this title officially, I'll call off my troops and let
Heaven and Earth continue in peace; but if he refuses I'm coming up to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to knock
him off his dragon throne." When the Mighty Miracle God heard this he looked hard and saw that a tall pole
had been planted outside the entrance to the cave, on which hung a banner reading GREAT SAGE
EQUALING HEAVEN.
"Heh, heh, heh," he mocked, "you ignorant ape. What shameless effrontery, to want to be a 'Great Sage
Equaling Heaven!' Take that!" He swung with his battle−axe at the Monkey King who, quite unflustered,
parried with his gold banded cudgel. It was a fine battle:
The cudgel was called As−You−Will,
The axe was named Flower Spreader.
As soon as the two met,
You could not tell which was better:
Axe and club
Locked together.
One was concealing his magic powers,
One was a big−mouthed boaster.
They used their magic
To breathe out cloud and mist;
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 55
When they opened their hands
They scattered sand and dust.
The heavenly general was a master of magic;
Endless were the changes the Monkey King could make.
When the cudgel was raised it was like a dragon playing in the water;
As the axe came down it was a phoenix among the flowers.
Although the fame of Miracle was known throughout the world,
His skill was no match for his enemy.
If the Great Sage lightly twirled his club,
A mere touch would paralyze.
The Mighty Miracle God was no match for his opponent. He hastened to block the Monkey King's first blow
with his axe, which broke in two with a crunch. He fled for his life as fast as he could, and the Monkey King
said mockingly, "You bag of pus, I'll spare you this time. Hurry back with my message, and look sharp about
it."
The Mighty Miracle God returned to his camp, went straight to the Pagoda−bearing Heavenly King Li Jing,
knelt before him, and said with an awkward laugh, "The Protector of the Horses has really tremendous magic
powers. I was no match for him. He beat me, and now I have come to take my punishment."
"This fool has ruined our morale," exploded the Heavenly King Li in a fury. "Take him away, and off with his
head."
Prince Nezha, who was standing to one side, stepped forward, bowed, and said, "Do not be angry, Your
Majesty. Forgive the Mighty Miracle God, and let me go and do battle; then we'll see who's boss." The
heavenly king accepted his advice, and told Mighty Miracle God to go back and look after the camp while he
awaited his punishment.
When he had put on his armour and helmet, Prince Nezha charged straight out of the camp to the Water
Curtain Cave. Sun Wukong, who was just going to pull back his troops, saw the ferocity of his onslaught.
What a fine prince he was:
His hair in tufts barely covers his scalp,
His cloak not over his shoulders.
How striking his intelligence,
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 56
How elegant his air.
Indeed he is the scion of a unicorn in Heaven;
In truth he is a phoenix Immortal from the clouds.
The seed of dragons is different from the common herd;
This fine youth is not at all like mortals.
With him he carries six divine weapons;
Endless his transformations as he soars through the air.
Now he has received an edict from the Jade Emperor's mouth,
Making him Commander of the Three Temples of the Masses.
Sun Wukong went up to him and asked, "Whose little boy are you then? What do you mean, charging up to
my door?"
"Stinking monkey fiend," shouted Prince Nezha, "don't you know who I am? I am Nezha, the third son of the
pagoda−bearing Heavenly King, and I have been commanded by the Jade Emperor to come here and arrest
you."
"You do talk big, don't you, little prince," said Sun Wukong, laughing at him. "But as you've still got all your
milk teeth and are still wet behind the ears I'll spare your life and I won't hit you. Do you see what it says on
my standard? Go and tell the Jade Emperor that if he gives me that title I'll call off my armies and submit to
him once more. But if he doesn't do what I want him to, I'll surely attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist." Nezha
looked up and saw the words "Great Sage Equaling Heaven."
"You wicked monkey! How dare you give yourself a title like that, whatever your magic powers may be!
Don't worry, all you're getting is my sword."
"Give me a few swipes, then," replied Sun Wukong, "I won't move."
"Change," yelled Nezha in a passion, and at once he had three heads and six arms, which made him look most
ferocious. In his hands he held six weapons, a demon−beheading sword, a demon−hacking cutlass, a
demon−binding rope, a demon−quelling pestle, an embroidered ball, and a fire−wheel−−and wielding all
these he rushed straight at Sun Wukong.
At the sight of him Sun Wukong exclaimed with astonishment, "Well, my boy, you certainly know a trick or
two. But just behave yourself and watch what I can do." Our dear Great Sage shouted "Change," and he too
had three heads and six arms. He shook his gold−banded cudgel, and it turned into three cudgels, which he
gripped with his six hands to ward off Nezha's blows. It was a great fight, and it made the earth shake and the
mountains tremble:
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 57
Six−armed Prince Nezha
Heaven−born Monkey King:
Well−matched opponents,
Both in the same class.
One sent down to the lower world on a mission,
The other priding himself as a fighting bull.
Fast moves the point of the demon−beheading sword,
And evil spirits fear the demon−hacking cutlass,
The demon−binding rope flies like a dragon,
While the demon−quelling pestle has the head of a wolf,
The fire−wheel flashes with lightning,
And the embroidered ball shoots everywhere.
The Great Sage's three As−You−Will cudgels
Block and parry with consummate skill.
Though many hard−fought rounds prove inconclusive,
The prince refuses to call the battle off;
Making his six weapons multiply in number,
He throws them in their millions at the Monkey King's head,
But the Monkey King, fearless, roars with laughter
As his iron clubs whirl and think for themselves.
One becomes a thousand; one thousand, ten;
Their wild dance fills the sky as if with dragons.
All the demon kings shut their gates in terror;
Every goblin on the mountain finds some place to hide.
Cloud−black, the anger of the heavenly troops;
Whistling like the wind, the gold−banded cudgels.
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 58
On the one side,
The blood−curdling war−cries of the heavenly host.
On the other,
The spine−chilling banners of the monkey fiends.
Both parties are equal in fighting courage;
Neither could be said to be the winner.
Prince Nezha and Sun Wukong both used their divine powers to the full as they fought thirty rounds. When
the six weapons of the prince turned into thousands and tens of thousands, so did Sun Wukong's gold−banded
cudgel. The air was filled as if with drops of rain or shooting stars, and there was no way of telling who was
winning. As Sun Wukong was deft of hand and quick of eye, he plucked one of the hairs from his body in the
midst of the fray and shouted "Change!" It changed into his own double to mislead Nezha while his real self
leapt round till he was behind Nezha and struck at his left shoulder. Nezha was in the middle of performing a
spell when he heard the whistle of the cudgel through the air and twisted away as fast as he could. But he was
unable to avoid the blow and had to flee wounded. He brought his magic to an end, put his six weapons away,
reverted to his true appearance, and abandoned the field of battle in defeat.
This had all been observed by Heavenly King Li, who was on the point of sending reinforcements when his
son appeared before him and reported in fear and trembling, "Father, the Protector of the Horses is very
powerful. My magic was outclassed and he has wounded me in the shoulder."
The color drained from the face of the horror−struck Heavenly King as he said, "If the creature has magic
powers like that, how are we going to defeat him?"
"Outside the gates of the cave," the prince went on to report, "there is a banner on a pole that reads 'Great
Sage Equaling Heaven'. He bragged that if the Jade Emperor gave him this title he would call everything off;
otherwise he said he would attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist."
"In that case," said the Heavenly King, "we'll disengage now, go back to Heaven, and request that more
heavenly troops be sent to capture this wretch. There is plenty of time." The prince, in pain and unable to go
on fighting, went back to Heaven with the Heavenly King and put in this request, but of that no more for the
moment.
Watch as the Monkey King returns to the mountain in triumph to receive the congratulations of the
seventy−two kings of the monsters and his six sworn brothers. There was great drinking and singing in the
cave paradise. Sun Wukong said to his six sworn brothers, "As I've called myself Great Sage Equaling
Heaven, you can all call yourselves great sages too."
"Honorable brother, you're right," roared the Bull Demon King. "I shall call myself the Great Sage Matching
Heaven."
"I'll be the Great Sage Overturning the Sea," said the Salamander Demon King.
"I'll be the Great Sage Throwing Heaven into Confusion," said the Roc Demon King.
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 59
"I'll be the Great Sage Who Moves Mountains," said the Camel Demon King.
"I'll be the Great Sage Who Travels with the Wind," said the Macaque King.
"And I'll be the Great Sage Who Drives Away Gods," said the Lion King. The seven great sages then did just
as they pleased and gave themselves the titles they chose, and after enjoying themselves all day they went
home.
Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha led their forces straight to the Palace of Miraculous Mist and made this
request: "We, your subjects, took our forces down to the lower world, under your Divine Edict, to subdue the
immortal fiend Sun Wukong. But to our surprise we found that his magical powers were too far−reaching for
us to be able to defeat him. We therefore hope that Your Imperial Majesty will send more troops to
exterminate him."
"How could a mere monkey goblin have such great powers that you actually need more troops?" asked the
Jade Emperor.
Prince Nezha then came forward and memorialized, "We beg Your Majesty to spare us the deaths we deserve.
That monkey fiend has an iron cudgel that he used to defeat the Mighty Miracle God and wounded me on the
shoulder. He has set a banner up outside the entrance to his cave that reads 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' and
he says that if you give him this office he will stop fighting and submit; otherwise he will attack the Hall of
Miraculous Mist."
When the Jade Emperor heard this he asked in horror, "How dare that monkey fiend talk so wildly? Send all
the generals to execute him at once."
As he spoke the Great White Planet stepped forward from the ranks of officials. "That monkey fiend knows
how to talk," he suggested, "but he has no idea about real power. If more soldiers were sent to fight him, they
might not be able to overcome him at once and their energies would be wasted. But if Your Imperial Majesty
were to show your great mercy, you could send down a pacificatory amnesty and let him be a Great Sage
Equaling Heaven. It would only be an empty title that he was given, just an honorary appointment."
"What do you mean by an honorary appointment?" asked the Jade Emperor.
"He would be called a Great Sage Equaling Heaven, but he would not be given any responsibility or paid any
salary. He would be kept between Heaven and Earth, where his evil nature would be under control and he
would be kept from wickedness. Thus Heaven and Earth can be at peace, while sea and sky enjoy
tranquillity." The Jade Emperor approved this suggestion and ordered that a new edict should be issued for the
Great White Planet to deliver.
The Great White Planet left once more through the Southern Gate of Heaven and went straight to have a look
at the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. It was quite different from before. There was
an awe−inspiring and spine−chilling atmosphere, and every kind of fiend was present. They were roaring and
leaping around with their swords, spears, cutlasses and staves. As soon as they saw the Great White Planet
they all went for him.
"Will your commander please come forward," said the Planet. "I would trouble you to inform your Great Sage
that I am a heavenly envoy sent by the Jade Emperor, and I am carrying a divine edict with an invitation for
him."
Journey to the West
Chapter 4 60
The fiends rushed in to report, "There's an old man outside who says he's come from Heaven with an edict of
invitation for you."
When Sun Wukong heard this he said, "I'm glad he's come. I expect he's that Great White Planet who came
before. Although I wasn't given a decent job last time I went to Heaven, I did get up there and learn my way
around. If it's him again, his intentions must be good." He told his commanders to put on a big display of
banners and drums and to turn out a guard of honour to welcome him.
Then the Great Sage, wearing his helmet, his yellow robe over his armour, and his cloud−walking shoes,
hurried out of the cave at the head of his monkey host, bowed in greeting, and shouted in a loud voice, "Please
come in, venerable Planet. Forgive me for not being here to welcome you."
The Planet walked straight into the cave, stood facing the South and said, "Great Sage, when you left the
Imperial Stables because you found the post too humble, the officials of that department naturally reported the
matter to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor decreed that all officials have to work their way up from the
bottom, and asked why you objected to its being humble. After this Heavenly King Li took Nezha down to the
lower world to do battle with you. Your divine powers, Great Sage, were more than they expected, and they
suffered defeat. On their return to Heaven they reported that you had set up a banner and wanted to be a 'Great
Sage Equaling Heaven'. All the generals wanted to punish you; but I, Great Sage, ran the risk of punishment
by suggesting that the armies should not be called out, and that Your Majesty should be given a post instead.
The Jade Emperor approved my memorial, and that is why I have come here to invite you."
"I am most grateful for this honour after the trouble I caused you earlier," replied Sun Wukong, "but I am not
sure whether there is such a title as 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven' in the upper world."
"After obtaining imperial approval for this title," said the Planet, "I came down bearing a decree. If anything
goes wrong, I'll bear the responsibility."
A highly delighted Sun Wukong tried his hardest to persuade the Planet to stay to a banquet, but without
success, so he went with him by propitious cloud to the Southern Gate of Heaven. The heavenly generals and
soldiers all greeted them with respectfully folded arms, and they went straight to the Hall of Miraculous Mist.
The Great White Planet did obeisance and said, "In obedience to the imperial edict your subject has
summoned Sun Wukong, the Protector of the Horses, and he is present."
"Let Sun Wukong come forward," said the Jade Emperor. "We do now proclaim you Great Sage Equaling
Heaven. Your rank is now very high. Let there be no more mischief from you." The monkey simply chanted
"na−a−aw" to express his thanks to the Emperor. The Jade Emperor then ordered the two officials in charge of
public works, Zhang and Lu, to build a residence for the Great Sage Equaling Heaven to the left of the Peach
Orchard. In the residence there were to be two offices: a Tranquillity Office and a Calm Divinity Office. Both
these offices were to have immortal clerks and senior and junior assistants. He then told the Star Lords of the
Constellation Five to escort Sun Wukong to his post, and in addition gave him two bottles of imperial wine
and ten golden flowers, and admonished him to settle down and keep out of mischief. The Monkey King
accepted the order and went that same day with the Star Lords of the Constellation Five to his residence,
where he opened the bottles of wine and drained them dry with the help of all present. He then saw the star
officials off and returned to his own palace. From then on he lived in happiness and content, and enjoyed
untrammelled pleasure in the Palace. Truly,
His immortal name was for ever inscribed in the register of eternal life,

Chapter 4 61
To be transmitted for ten thousand ages, free of the wheel of rebirth.
If you don't know what happened next, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 5
After Chaos Among the Peaches the Great Sage Steals the Pills
In the Revolt Against Heaven the Gods Capture the Demons
The story goes on to relate that the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, a mere monkey devil after all, was quite
satisfied that his name was on the register of office without caring about the grading of his job and his own
rank, or the size of his salary. The immortal clerks in the two offices in his residence were in constant
attendance on him, he had three meals a day and a bed to sleep on at night, and he lived a free and easy life
without worries. In his spare time he would visit the other palaces, get together with his old friends, and make
new ones. When he saw the Three Pure Ones, he would address them as "venerable," and when he met the
Four Emperors he called them "Your Majesty." He was on fraternal terms with the Nine Bright Shiners, the
Generals of the Five Regions, the Twenty−Eight Constellations, the Four Great Heavenly Kings, the Gods of
the Twelve Branches, the Five Ancients of the Five Regions, the star ministers of the whole sky, and the
countless gods of the Milky Way. Today he would wander East, and tomorrow he would go West, coming and
going by cloud, and never staying anywhere for long.
When the Jade Emperor was holding his morning court one day the Immortal Xu of Jingyang came forward
from the body of officials, kowtowed, and suggested, "The Great Sage Equaling Heaven is spending his time
in idle travel, and is making the acquaintance of all the stars in the sky, calling them all his friends irrespective
of their rank. It would be as well to give him some responsibility, and prevent his idleness leading to trouble
later on."
The Jade Emperor's response to this suggestion was to send for the Monkey King at once. He came in a
cheerful mood and asked, "What promotion and reward have you summoned me here to receive, Your
Majesty?"
"Seeing that you are idle and have nothing to do," replied the Jade Emperor, "we are giving you a job. You are
to administer the Peach Orchard, and you will give it your attention day and night." The Great Sage was
overjoyed, and after expressing his thanks and chanting "na−a−aw" he withdrew.
In his eagerness to be at work he went straight to the Peach Orchard to have a look round. When he got there
he was stopped by a local tutelary god who asked him, "Where are you going, Great Sage?"
"I've been put in charge of the Peach Orchard by the Jade Emperor, and I've come to inspect it." The local god
hastened to greet him formally, and he called the men who weeded, brought water, looked after the trees, and
swept the grounds to come and kowtow to the Great Sage. When Sun Wukong was taken inside this is what
he saw:
Charming,
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 62
Every tree.
Charming and luxuriant the full blossom;
Every tree weighed down with fruit.
The fruit−laden branches bend like carding−bows;
The blossoming trees are covered with powder and rouge.
Always blossoming, always in fruit, they are ripe for a thousand years;
They know no summer or winter, but linger for ever.
The early ripeners
Look red−faced and tipsy;
The ones still growing
Are green in stalk and skin.
When the dew forms, their flesh has a touch of blue,
While the sun picks out their vermilion beauty.
Below the trees exotic flowers grow,
Bright and unfading throughout the year.
On either side stand towers and pavilions,
And a rainbow always arches the sky.
These are not the common breeds of the Dark Earth Capital,
But are tended by the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool.
After taking a good look at this the Great Sage asked the local god, "How many of these trees are there?"
"Three thousand six hundred all together," the local god replied. "The ones growing at the front have tiny
blossoms and small fruits, and they ripen every three thousand years. Anyone who eats them becomes an
Immortal and understands the Way, and his body becomes both light and strong. The twelve hundred in the
middle have multiple blossoms and sweet fruits, and ripen every six thousand years; whoever eats them can
fly and enjoy eternal youth. The back twelve hundred are streaked with purple and have pale yellow stones.
They ripen once every nine thousand years, and anyone who eats them becomes as eternal as Heaven and
Earth, as long−lived as the Sun and Moon." The Great Sage was beside himself with joy on learning this, and
that day he checked the number of the trees and looked over the buildings in the orchard before going back to
his residence. From then on he went to admire them every three or four days. He dropped his friends, and
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 63
made no more pleasure jaunts.
One day he noticed that the peaches near the end of the branches of one old tree were all but ripe, and he felt
like trying one; but as the local god, the workmen, and the immortal clerks from his residence were close on
his heels it was impossible. Suddenly he had an idea, and he said, "Go and wait for me outside the gates while
I take a nap in this summer−house."
All the Immortals thereupon withdrew, and the Monkey King took off his official hat and clothes, climbed
one of the bigger trees, and chose some large, ripe peaches. When he had picked a good number he sat at his
ease in the branches and ate his fill of them, then jumped down from the tree, pinned on his hat, put on his
clothes, and shouted for all his attendants to go back to his residence with him. Two or three days later he
thought of another trick to steal some more peaches, and he ate his fill of them.
One day the Queen Mother arranged a banquet, opening many precious pavilions for a feast of peaches by the
Jade Pool. She sent the Red Fairy, the Blue Fairy, the White Fairy, the Black Fairy, the Purple Fairy, the
Yellow Fairy, and the Green Fairy to the Peach Orchard with their baskets to pick peaches for the feast. The
seven fairies went straight to the orchard gates, the workmen of the orchard and the immortal superintendents
of the two offices of the Equaling Heaven Residence were guarding the gate.
The fairies went up to them and said, "We have come on the orders of the Queen Mother to pick peaches for a
feast."
"Wait a moment please, Immortal Beauties," said the local god. "Things are different this year. The Jade
Emperor has appointed the Great Sage Equaling Heaven to be the guardian of this orchard, and we must ask
him before we can open the orchard to you."
"Where is the Great Sage?" the fairies asked, and the local god replied, "Inside the orchard. As he was feeling
tired he is having a nap by himself in a summerhouse."
"In that case, please find him without delay," requested the fairies, and the local god took them into the
orchard. But all they could find of him in the summerhouse were his hat and clothes. They had no idea where
he could have gone, and looked everywhere without success. The Great Sage had in fact made himself only
two inches long after eating some of the peaches for fun, and he was sleeping under a large leaf at the top of
one of the big trees.
"We have come by decree, and we can't go back empty−handed, although the Great Sage is nowhere to be
found," said the fairies.
One of the immortal superintendents who was standing nearby replied, "As you Immortal Beauties have come
by order of the Queen Mother, we must not delay you. Our Great Sage is always wandering off, so I expect
that he has gone away to visit some of his friends. You had better pick the peaches; it will be all right if we
inform him."
The fairies did as he suggested and went into the orchard to pick peaches. First they filled two baskets from
the trees in front, and then they picked three basketfuls from the trees in the middle; but when they came to
the trees at the back, they saw that peaches and blossoms were few and far between. Only a few unripe fruits
with furry stalks and green skins were left. All the ripe ones had been eaten up by the Monkey King. The
seven fairies looked everywhere, but all they could see was a single red and white peach on a Southern
branch. The Blue Fairy pulled the branch down, the Red Fairy picked the peach, and then they let the branch
go again. This woke up the Great Sage, who had changed himself into this peach to take a nap on this branch.
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 64
He resumed his own form, took his gold−banded cudgel from his ear, shook it till it was as thick as a
ricebowl, and shouted at them, "Where are you from, you thieving fiends?" The seven fairies fell on their
knees in confusion.
"Please don't be angry with us, Great Sage. We're not fiends but seven fairies sent by Her Majesty the Queen
Mother of the West to pick peaches of immortality and open the precious halls here for a Feast of Peaches.
When we arrived here we saw the local god and other deities of the place, but we could not find you, Great
Sage. We could not delay carrying out the Queen Mother's orders, so we went ahead and picked the peaches
without waiting for you, Great Sage. We very much hope that you will forgive us."
These words turned the Great Sage's bad mood into a good one, and he said, "Please rise, Fairy Beauties. Who
is the Queen Mother inviting to this feast?"
"There are old rules about who attends: The Buddha of the Western Heaven, Bodhisattvas, holy monks,
Arhats, the Guanyin of the South Pole, the Merciful and Sage Emperor of the East, the Venerable Immortals
of the Ten Continents and the Three Islands, the Mystic Divinity of the North Pole, and the Great
Yellow−horned Immortal of the Yellow Pole at the Centre. These make up the Five Venerable Ones of the
Five Regions. There will also be the Star Lords of the Five Constellation; the Three Pure Ones, the Four
Emperors and the Heavenly Immortal of the Great Monad from the Eight High Caves; the Jade Emperor, the
immortals of the Nine Mounds, and the gods of the Seas and Mountains and the Ruler of the Nether World
from the Eight Lower Caves; and the terrestrial deities. All the major and minor gods of all the halls and
palaces will come to the Feast of Peaches."
"Will I be invited?" asked the Great Sage with an ingratiating smile.
"Not as far as we've heard," the fairies replied.
"I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, so why shouldn't I be asked?" said the Great Sage.
"That was what happened before: we don't know about this time," the fairies replied.
"You're right," he said. "Just wait here while I go and find out whether I'm invited."
Splendid Great Sage. Making a magic with his hands as he spoke the words of the spell, he said to the fairies,
"Stay where you are! Stay where you are!" As this was an immobilizing spell, the seven fairies were left
standing in a daze under the peach tree with their eyes wide open as the Great Sage leapt out of the orchard on
a somersault cloud and headed for the Jade Pool. As he traveled he saw that
The sky shimmered with auspicious light
As clouds of many colours streamed across it.
The white stork's cry made the heavens shake;
A thousand leaves grew on the purple asphodel.
Amid it all an Immortal appeared,
Carrying himself with heaven−sent elegance,
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 65
As he danced on the rainbow, cloaked by the Milky Way,
With a talisman at his waist to ward off birth and death.
His name was Bare−Foot Immortal,
And he was going to the feast of longevity−giving peaches.
As the Bare−foot Immortal saw him, the Great Sage lowered his head and thought of a plan by which to trick
the Immortal and get to the banquet himself.
"Where are you going, reverend sir?" he asked; and the Immortal replied, "I'm going to the Peach Banquet by
the invitation of the Queen Mother."
"There is something you do not know, venerable sir," said the Great Sage. "As my somersault cloud is so fast,
the Jade Emperor has sent me everywhere to tell all you gentlemen to go to the Hall of Universal Brightness
for a ceremony before going on to the banquet."
As the Immortal was an open and upright man, he took this lie for the truth, but wondered, "The thanksgiving
ceremony is usually held by the Jade Pool, so why are we having the ceremony in the Hall of Universal
Brightness before going to the Jade Pool for the banquet?" Nevertheless, he turned his propitious cloud around
and went to the Hall of Universal Brightness.
As the Great Sage rode his cloud he said a spell, shook himself, took the form of the Bare−foot Immortal, and
hurried to the Jade Pool. He reached the pavilion there a moment later, stopped his cloud, and went quietly
inside. He saw
Fabulous perfumes coiling,
A confusion of auspicious clouds;
The jade tower set with color,
The precious pavilions scattering mists;
The phoenix soars till almost lost to view,
And jeweled flowers seem to rise and fall.
Above a nine−phoenix screen
A rainbow stool of the eight precious things,
A coloured golden table,
Green jade bowls with a thousand flowers.
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 66
On the table were dragon livers and marrow of phoenix bone,
Bears' paws and apes' lips−−
A hundred different dishes, and all of them good;
Rare fruits and fine delicacies, every one unique.
Everything was neatly set out, but no Immortals had yet arrived. The Great Sage had not finished looking
when he smelt wine; and as he whirled round he saw under a portico to the right several immortal officials in
charge of brewing liquor with some workmen who stirred the lees, a number of novices who carried water and
some boys who looked after the fires. They were washing the vats and scrubbing the pots, having made jade
liquor and a fragrant fermentation of the lees. The Great Sage could not stop himself from drooling, and he
longed to drink some, but unfortunately all those people were there. So he performed a spell by pulling several
hairs from his body, chewing them up, spitting them up, saying the magic words, and shouting "Change";
whereupon the hairs turned into sleep insects, which flew into the faces of all the liquor−makers. Watch them
as their hands go limp, their heads droop, their eyes close, and they drop their symbols of office and all fall
asleep. Whereupon the Great Sage grabbed the rare delicacies and exotic foods, then went under the portico
and drank from the vats and pots until he was completely drunk.
Only then did he think, "This won't do at all. When the guests come for the banquet they'll be furious with me,
and I'll be for it if I'm caught. I'd better get back to the Residence as soon as I can and sleep it off."
Our dear Great Sage staggered and swayed, charging about all over the place under the influence of the liquor,
and going the wrong way. He arrived not at the Equaling Heaven Residence but at the Tushita Heavenly
Palace. As soon as he saw this he sobered up and said to himself, "The Tushita Palace is the highest of the
thirty−three heavens, where Lord Lao Zi of the Great Monad reigns. However did I get here? Never mind, I've
always wanted to see that old chap, and I've never managed to come here before. I might as well go and have
a look at him now that I'm passing this way."
He straightened his clothes and rushed in, but did not see Lord Lao Zi. There was no sign of anyone. This was
because Lao Zi and the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara were expounding the Way from a red dais in a
triple−storied pavilion, and all the immortal boys, generals, officials and petty functionaries were standing to
right and left listening to the lecture. The Great Sage went straight to the room in which the elixir was kept,
and although he could not find Lao Zi there he saw that there was a small fire in the stove beside the range
over which pills were made. On either side of the stove were five gourds, full of golden pills of refined elixir.
"This is the Immortals' greatest treasure," he exclaimed in delight. "I've wanted to refine some of these golden
pills to save people with ever since I understood the Way and mastered the principle of the correspondence of
the Esoteric and Exoteric, but I've never had time to come here. Today I'm in luck−−I've found them. As Lao
Zi isn't here I'll try a few." He emptied the gourds of their contents and ate up all the pills as if he were eating
fried beans.
Before long he was full of pills and quite sober. "This is terrible," he thought, "this is a colossal disaster. If the
Jade Emperor is shocked by this, I'm done for. I must get out of here. I'd be much better off as a king in the
lower world."
He rushed out of the Tushita Palace, avoiding his usual route. Using a spell to make himself invisible, he left
by the West Gate of Heaven, and went straight down to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit by cloud. When he
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 67
got there he saw flags, banners, spears and halberds gleaming in the sun: the four Stalwart Generals and the
seventy−two kings of the monsters were holding military exercises.
"Children, I'm back," shouted the Great Sage in a loud voice, and all the fiends dropped their weapons and fell
to their knees.
"You don't care, do you, Great Sage?" they said. "It's been so long since you left us, and you never came back
to see us."
"I haven't been long, I haven't been long," protested the Great Sage, and as they talked they walked into the
innermost part of the cave. When the four Stalwart General's had tidied the place up and made him sit down,
they kowtowed to him and asked, "What office did you hold, Great Sage, during your century and more in
Heaven?"
The Great Sage laughed and said, "As far as I can remember it was only six months, so why do you say it was
over a century?"
"A day in Heaven is the same as a year on earth," the Stalwart Generals replied.
"I was lucky this time," said the Great Sage. "The Jade Emperor took a liking to me and ennobled me as the
Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He had an Equaling Heaven Residence built for me, complete with a
Tranquillity Office and a Calm Divinity Office with Immortal functionaries, attendants and guards. Later on,
when he saw that I had nothing to do, he put me in charge of the Peach Orchard. Recently the Queen Mother
Goddess gave a Peach Banquet, but she didn't invite me. Instead of waiting for an invitation, I went to the
Jade Pool and stole all the immortal food and drink. I staggered away from the Jade Pool and blundered into
Lord Lao Zi's palace, and there I ate up his five gourds of pills of immortality. Then I got out through the
heavenly gates and came here because I was scared that the Jade Emperor was going to punish me."
All the fiends were delighted with what they heard, and they laid on liquor and fruit with which to welcome
him back.
They filled a stone bowl with coconut toddy and handed it to him, but when he tasted it the Great Sage
grimaced and said, "It's awful, it's awful."
Two of his Stalwart Generals, Beng and Ba, explained, "You don't find coconut toddy very tasty because you
have drunk immortal liquor and eaten immortal food in the heavenly palace, Great Sage. But as the saying
goes, 'Sweet or not, it's water from home.'"
To this the Great Sage replied, "And all of you, whether related to me or not, are from my home. When I was
enjoying myself beside the Jade Pool today I saw jars and jars of jade liquor under a portico there. As none of
you have ever tasted it I'll go and pinch you a few jars; then you can each have a little drink, and live for
ever." All the monkeys were beside themselves with glee. The Great Sage then went out of the cave, turned a
somersault, made himself invisible, and went straight to the Peach Banquet. As he went through the gates of
the Jade Pool he saw that the men who made the wine, stirred the lees, carried the water, and looked after the
fire were still snoring away. He tucked two big jars of wine under his arms, took two more in his hands, then
turned his cloud round and went back to have a feast of immortal wine with the monkey masses in the cave.
They all drank several cups and were very happy, but we will not go into this.
The story returns to the seven fairies, who were only able to free themselves a whole day after Sun Wukong
had immobilized them with his magic. They picked up their baskets and went back to report to the Queen
Mother that they were late because the Great Sage Equaling Heaven had held them there by magic.
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 68
"How many peaches did you pick?" the Queen Mother asked.
"Two baskets of little ones and three baskets of medium ones. But when we got to the back we could not find
a single big one; we think that they were all eaten by the Great Sage. While we were looking for some the
Great Sage suddenly appeared, and he beat and tortured us to make us tell him who had been invited to the
banquet. After we had told him he immobilized us there, and we don't know where he went. We only came
round and freed ourselves a moment ago."
On hearing this the Queen Mother went to see the Jade Emperor and gave him a full account of what had
happened. Before she had finished, the liquor−makers arrived with their immortal officials to report that an
unknown person had thrown the Grand Peach Banquet into confusion and stolen the jade liquor as well as the
precious delicacies of a hundred flavors. Then came Four Heavenly Teachers to announce that the Supreme
Patriarch of the Way, Lao Zi, had arrived.
The Jade Emperor went out with the Queen Mother to meet him, and after doing obeisance Lao Zi said, "I had
refined some Golden Pills of the Nine Transformations in my palace for a Feast of Elixir Pills with Your
Majesty, but a thief has stolen them. This is what I have come to report to Your Majesty." This news made the
Jade Emperor tremble with fear.
Not long afterwards the immortal administrators from the Equaling Heaven Residence came to kowtow and
report: "The Great Sage Sun Wukong abandoned his post and went wandering off yesterday. He has not come
back yet and we do not know where he has gone." The Jade Emperor, now more suspicious than ever, then
saw the Bare−Foot Immortal bow his head to the ground.
"Your subject was going to the banquet on a summons from the Queen Mother," he reported, "when I
happened to meet the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He told me, O Lord of Ten Thousand Years, that you had
issued a decree ordering him to tell all the rest of us to go to the Hall of Universal Brightness for a ceremony
before going to the banquet. Your subject went back to the Hall of Universal Brightness as he had told me to,
but as I did not see the Imperial Dragon and Phoenix Chariot outside I hurried here to await orders."
"This wretch has the impudence to invent fraudulent decrees and deceive eminent ministers," exclaimed the
Jade Emperor with anger and astonishment. "The Miraculous Investigator is to find out at once what he has
been up to."
The Miraculous Investigator left the palace in obedience to the edict, and by making thorough enquiries he
found out all the details of what had happened.
"The wrecker of the Heavenly Palace was Sun Wukong," he reported, and he went on to give a full account.
The Jade Emperor was furiously angry, and he ordered the Four Great Heavenly Kings along with Heavenly
King Li and Prince Nezha to mobilize the Twenty−eight Constellations, the Nine Bright Shiners, the Twelve
Gods of the Twelve Branches, the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions, the Four Duty Gods, the
Constellations of the East and West, the Gods of the North and South, the Deities of the Five Mountains and
the Four Rivers, the star ministers of all Heaven, and a total of a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers. They
were to descend to the lower world with eighteen heaven−and−earth nets, surround the Mountain of Flowers
and Fruit, and capture that wretch for punishment. The gods called out their troops at once, and left the
heavenly palace.
A gusty sandstorm blotted out the heavens,
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 69
Purple fog threw the earth into darkness.
Just because the monkey fiend offended the Supreme Emperor
Heavenly hosts were sent down to the mortal dust.
The Four Great Heavenly Kings,
The Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions.
The Four Great Heavenly Kings held the supreme command,
And the Revealers controlled the soldiers' movements.
Li the Pagoda Carrier commanded the central corps,
Nezha the deadly led the van.
The star Rahu ordered the leading rands,
And the star Ketu towered behind.
The Sun revealed his divinity,
And radiance shone from the Moon.
The stars of the Five Elements were mighty in valour,
And the Nine Bright Shiners were fond of battle.
The stars of the Branches Zi, Wu, Mao and You,
Were all great heavenly warriors.
The Five Plagues and the Five Mountains were drawn up on the East and West,
While the Six Ding and Six Jia marched to right and left.
The Dragon Gods of the Four Rivers stood above and below,
And the Twenty−eight Constellations were drawn up in serried ranks:
Horn, Gullet, Base, and Chamber were the officers commanding,
Strider, Harvester, Stomach, and Mane wheeled and soared;
Dipper, Ox, Woman, Barrens, Roof, House, and Wall, Heart, Tail, and
Winnower−−all able stars−−
Well, Ghost, Willow, Spread, Whig and Axletree
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 70
Wielded their swords and spears, showed forth their power,
Halted their clouds and descended in mists to the mortal world,
Pitching camp before the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.
There is a poem that runs:
Many the transformations of the heaven−born Monkey King
Happy in his lair after stealing the pills and wine.
Just because he wrecked the banquet of peaches,
A hundred thousand heavenly troops now spread their nets.
Heavenly King Li gave the order for the heavenly soldiers to pitch camp and throw a watertight cordon round
the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Above and below they spread eighteen heaven−and−earth nets, and the
Nine Bright Shiners were sent out to start the battle. They took their soldiers to the outside of the cave, where
they saw the monkeys, big and small, leaping and fooling around.
The star officers shouted in harsh voices, "Little goblins, where's that Great Sage of yours? We are gods, sent
from the upper world to subdue your mutinous Great Sage. Tell him to surrender at once−−−and if there's so
much as a hint of a 'no' from him, we will exterminate every last one of you."
The little monkeys went rushing in to report, "Great Sage, a disaster, a disaster. There are nine evil gods
outside who say they've been sent from the upper world to subdue you."
The Great Sage, who was just then sharing the immortal liquor with the seventy−two kings of the monsters
and his four Stalwart Generals, paid no attention to the report, saying:
"Today we have wine so today we celebrate:
To hell with what's happening outside the gate."
But before the words were out of his mouth another group of little devils came in. "Those nine evil gods are
using foul and provocative language to challenge us to fight," they announced.
"Never mind them," said the Great Sage with a laugh.
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 71
"With verse and wine we're happy today;
Who cares when fame will come our way?"
But before these words were out of his mouth yet another group of devils came rushing in. "Sir, those nine
evil gods have smashed the gates and are charging in."
"The stinking gods!" exploded the Great Sage, "What nerve! I never wanted a fight with them, so why should
they come here to push us around?" He thereupon ordered the One−horned Monster King to lead the
seventy−two monster kings into battle while he followed them with the four Stalwart Generals. The monster
king hastily assembled the devil soldiers and sallied forth to meet the enemy. They were all stopped by a
charge by the Nine Bright Shiners, who held the head of the iron bridge so that no one could enter or leave.
During the tumult the Great Sage came on the scene, and shouting "Make way!" he raised his iron cudgel,
shook it till it was as thick as a bowl and twelve feet long, and struck and parried as he came charging out.
The Nine Bright Shiners, who were no match for him, fell back.
"You reckless Protector of the Horses," they shouted when they were back in the safety of their own position.
"You have committed the most terrible crimes. You stole the peaches and the wine, wrecked the Peach
Banquet, and pilfered the immortality pills of Lord Lao Zi. On top of all this you brought some of the
immortal liquor you stole back here. Don't you realize that you have piled crime upon crime?" The Great Sage
laughed.
"It's true, it's true," he said, "but what are you going to do about it?"
"In obedience to a golden edict of the Jade Emperor," the Nine Bright Shiners replied, "we have led out troops
here to subdue you. Submit at once, or else all these creatures of yours will have to pay with their lives. If you
refuse, we shall trample this mountain flat and turn your cave upside−down."
"You hairy gods," roared the Great Sage in a fury, "what magic powers have you got to let you talk so big?
Clear off, or I'll give you a taste of my cudgel." The Nine Bright Shiners did a war−dance together, which did
not frighten the Handsome Monkey King in the least. He whirled his gold−banded cudgel, parrying to right
and left, and fought the Nine Bright Shiners till their muscles were weak and their strength was gone; then
each of them broke ranks and fled, dragging their weapons behind them. They rushed to the command post of
the central corps and reported to the Pagoda−Bearing Heavenly King Li that the Monkey King was so
ferocious that they had fled from the battlefield, unable to defeat him. Heavenly King Li then sent the Four
Heavenly Kings and the Twenty−eight Constellations into battle. The Great Sage, not at all frightened at this,
ordered the One−horned Demon King, the seventy−two kings of the monsters, and the four Stalwart Generals
to draw up their line of battle outside the gates of the cave. The ensuing melee was really terrifying.
Howling winds,
Dark, sinister clouds.
On one side flags and standards colorfully flying,
On the other side the gleam of spears and halberds.
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 72
Round helmets shine,
Layered armour gleams.
The shining round helmets reflect the sun,
Like silver boulders reaching to the sky;
Gleaming layers of armour are built into a wall
Like a mountain of ice weighing down the earth.
Long−handled swords
Flash through the clouds like lightning;
Paper−white spears
Pierce mists and fogs;
Heaven−shaped halberds,
Tiger−eye chains,
Bristling like a field of hemp;
Bronze swords,
And four−brightness spears
Drawn up like a dense forest.
Bows and crossbows, eagle−feathered arrows,
Short clubs and snaky spears to terrify the soul.
Wielding his single As−You−Will cudgel,
The Great Sage fights against the heavenly gods.
Such is the slaughter that no bird flies over it;
And tigers and wolves flee in terror.
The swirling stones and clouds of sand make everything dark,
The dirt and the dust blot out the heavens.
The clash of arms startles the universe
As the battle strikes awe into gods and demons.
Journey to the West
Chapter 5 73
The battle started in the morning and went on till the sun set behind the mountains in the West. By then the
One−horned Demon King and the seventy−two kings of the monsters had all been captured by the heavenly
hosts. Only the four Stalwart Generals and the monkeys had got away, and they were now hiding in the
innermost recesses of the Water Curtain Cave. The Great Sage's solitary cudgel had fought off the Four
Heavenly Kings, Li the Pagoda−bearer and Prince Nezha, who were all in the sky. After the battle had gone
on for a long time the Great Sage saw that night was drawing on, so he plucked out one of his hairs, munched
it up, spat out the pieces and shouted, "Change!" They changed into thousands of Great Sages, all with
gold−banded cudgels, who forced Prince Nezha and the five Heavenly Kings to withdraw.
After winning this victory the Great Sage put back his hair and hurried back to the cave, where the four
Stalwart Generals at once led the monkeys out to kowtow at the head of the iron bridge to welcome him back.
They sobbed three times and then laughed three times.
"Why are you laughing and crying at the sight of me?" the Great Sage asked.
"When we led all the commanders into battle against the heavenly kings this morning," replied the Stalwart
Generals, "the seventy−two kings of the monsters and the One−horned Demon King were all captured by the
gods, and we had to flee for our lives. That is why we cried. We laughed because you, Great Sage, have come
back victorious and unharmed."
To this the Great Sage replied, "Victory and defeat are all the soldier's lot. As the ancients said, 'To kill ten
thousand of the enemy you must lose three thousand of your own.' Anyhow, the officers of ours who were
captured were all tigers, leopards, wolves, badgers, river−deer, foxes, and raccoon−dogs. Not one of our own
kind was even wounded, so there's no need for us to be bothered about it. But although I forced the enemy to
withdraw by dividing up my body through magic, they're still encamped at the foot of our mountain, so we'll
have to remain on our guard. Meanwhile we must eat a good meal and get a good night's sleep to build up our
energy. Tomorrow morning I'll use powerful magic to capture those heavenly generals and avenge our
people." After the four Stalwart Generals and the other monkey commanders had drunk several cups of
coconut toddy, they went to bed with their worries calmed.
When the four Heavenly Kings had withdrawn their troops and ended the battle, those who had distinguished
themselves reported what they had done. Some had captured tigers and leopards, some lions and elephants,
and others wolves and raccoon−dogs, but not one single monkey goblin had been taken. Then they built a
mighty stockade around their camp. Commanders who had distinguished themselves wee rewarded, and the
soldiers who made up the heaven−and−earth nets were ordered to surround the Mountain of Flowers and
Fruit, holding bells and shouting, ready for a great battle the next day. Every man heard the orders, and they
were strictly obeyed. Indeed:
A wicked monkey made chaos, shocking heaven and earth,
So they spread their nets and watched by night and day.
Listen to the next installment to hear how he was dealt with the following morning.

Chapter 6
Guanyin Comes to the Feast and Asks the Reason Why
The Little Sage Uses His Might to Subdue the Great Sage
We shall leave for the moment the Heavenly Generals making their encirclement and the soundly sleeping
Great Sage. The story goes on to tell how the Compassionate and Merciful Miraculous Savior from Suffering,
the Bodhisattva Guanyin of Mount Potaraka in the Southern Sea, having been invited by the Queen Mother to
the Peach Banquet, went to the precious pavilions at the Jade Pool with her great disciple Huian the Novice.
She found the place deserted and the banquet ruined. The few Immortals present were not sitting at their
places but holding confused discussions. When greetings were over the Immortals gave the Bodhisattva an
account of what had happened.
"If there is to be no banquet and no drinking," said the Bodhisattva, "you had better all come with me to the
Jade Emperor." The Immortals were delighted to follow her, and when they arrived before the Hall of
Universal Brightness the Four Heavenly Teachers, the Bare−Foot Immortal and many others were all there to
greet the Bodhisattva. They told her that the Jade Emperor had sent heavenly armies to capture the demon, but
they had not yet returned.
"I wish to see the Jade Emperor," said the Bodhisattva, "so may I trouble you to inform him on my behalf?"
The heavenly teacher Qui Hongji then went to the Hall of Miraculous Mist, and the Bodhisattva was invited
in. She found that Lord Lao Zi was there in the place of honour, and that the Queen Mother was behind him.
The Bodhisattva went in at the head of the others, and when she had done obeisance to the Jade Emperor she
greeted Lao Zi and the Queen Mother. After they had all sat down she asked what had happened at the Peach
Banquet.
"The banquet is held every year, and it is normally a very happy occasion," the Jade Emperor replied, "but this
year that monkey fiend wrecked it, so that your invitation was worth nothing."
"Where does this monkey fiend come from?" asked the Bodhisattva.
"He was born from a stone egg on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Eastern
Continent of Superior Body," the Jade Emperor answered. "When he was born golden beams flashed from his
eyes that reached to the star palace. At first we paid no attention to him, but later on he became a spirit,
subduing dragons and tigers, and erasing his own name from the registers of death. The Dragon Kings and
King Yama of the underworld informed us of this in memorials, and we wanted to capture him, but the Star of
Longevity memorialized that in the Three Worlds all beings with nine orifices can become Immortals. We
therefore extended education to the worthy by summoning him to the upper world and appointing him
Protector of the Horses in the Imperial Stable. But this was not good enough for the scoundrel, who rebelled
against Heaven. We sent Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha to accept his surrender, extended him an
amnesty, and summoned him back to the upper world. We made him a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' though
this carried no salary. As he had nothing to do he would go wandering all over the place, and for fear that this
might lead to trouble we had him look after the Peach Orchard. Once again he flouted the law by stealing and
eating every single one of the big peaches from the old trees. When the banquet was to be held he was not
invited as his position was purely an honorary one; so he played a trick on the Bare−foot Immortal, went to
the banquet looking like him, ate all the immortal delicacies, and drank all the immortal liquor. On top of this
he stole Lord Lao Zi's pills of immortality and some imperial liquor, which he took to his mountain for the
monkeys to enjoy. This made us very angry so we sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops to spread
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 75
heaven−and−earth nets and subdue him. But we have received no reports today, so we do not know whether
we have been victorious."
When the Bodhisattva heard this she said to Huian the Novice, "Hurry down from Heaven to the Mountain of
Flowers and Fruit and find out about the military situation. If you meet with any opposition you may do your
bit to help, but the important thing is to bring an accurate report back." Huian the Novice straightened his
robes, took his iron staff, left the palace by cloud, and went straight to the mountain. He saw that with the
layer upon layer of heaven−and−earth nets, and the men holding bells and shouting passwords at the gates of
the camp, the cordon round the mountain was watertight.
Huian stopped and called, "Heavenly soldiers at the gates of the camp, I would trouble you to report that I,
Moksa, the second son of Heavenly King Li, also known as Huian, the senior disciple of Guanyin of the
Southern Sea, have come to ask about the military situation." Then the divine soldiers of the Five Mountains
inside the camp went in through the gates of the headquarters, where the Rat, the Cock, the Horse and the
Hare stars reported the news to the commander of the central corps. Heavenly King Li sent a flag of command
with the order that the heaven−and−earth nets were to be opened to let Huian in. The East was just beginning
to grow light as Huian followed the flag in and bowed to Heavenly King Li and the four other heavenly kings.
"Where have you come from, my son?" asked Heavenly King Li.
"Your stupid son accompanied the Bodhisattva to the Peach Banquet, and when she found the banquet
deserted and nobody at the Jade Pool, she took me and the other Immortals to see the Jade Emperor. The Jade
Emperor told her that you, father, and the other kings had gone down to the lower world to capture this
monkey fiend. As the Jade Emperor has received no news all day on the outcome of the battle, the
Bodhisattva sent me here to find out what has happened."
"We arrived here and encamped yesterday," Heavenly King Li replied, "then sent the Nine Bright Shiners to
challenge the enemy to battle, but that wretch used such tremendous magic powers that the Nine Bright
Shiners all came back defeated. Then we led out own soldiers into action, and the wretch also drew up his line
of battle. Our hundred thousand heavenly soldiers fought an indecisive engagements with him till dusk when
he used a spell to divide up his body and force us back. When we withdrew our forces and held an
investigation, we found that we had only captured wolves, tigers, leopards, and so on, and had not even taken
half a monkey fiend. We have not yet given battle today."
Before he had finished speaking someone appeared outside the gates of the headquarters to report that the
Great Sage was outside at the head of a crowd of monkey spirits, clamoring for battle. The four other
Heavenly Kings, Heavenly King Li, and Prince Nezha were all for committing their forces, but Moksa said,
"Father, when your stupid son was instructed by the Bodhisattva to come here and find out the news, I was
also told that if there was a battle I could do my bit to help. May I please go and see what sort of a 'Great Sage'
he is, untalented though I am?"
"My boy," said Heavenly King Li, "you have been cultivating your conduct with the Bodhisattva for some
years now so I suppose that you must have acquired some magic powers, but do be very careful."
The splendid Prince Moksa hitched up his embroidered robes and charged out through the gates of the
headquarters waving his iron staff with both hands. "Which of you is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?" he
shouted.
"I am," answered the Great Sage, brandishing his As−You−Will cudgel. "But who do you think you are,
asking a question like that?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 76
"I am Prince Moksa, the second son of Heavenly King Li, and I am now a disciple and a guard before the
throne of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. My Buddhist name is Huian."
"Why have you come here to see me instead of staying in the Southern Sea and cultivating your conduct?"
asked the Great Sage, and Moksa replied, "My teacher sent me here to find out about the military situation,
but now that I've seen your savagery I've come to capture you."
"You talk big, don't you," said the Great Sage.
"Well then, don't go away, try a taste of my cudgel." Moksa, not in the least frightened, struck at him with his
iron staff. It was a fine fight they fought, half−way up the mountainside outside the gates of the headquarters.
The staves were matched, but made of different iron;
The weapons clashed, but their masters were not the same.
One was a wayward Immortal known as the Great Sage,
The other a true dragon disciple of Guanyin.
The cast−iron staff, beaten with a thousand hammers,
Had been forged by the art of the Ding and the Jia.
The As−You−Will cudgel once anchored the Milky Way:
As the Treasure Stilling the Sea its magic power was great.
When the two met they were well matched indeed.
And they parried and lunged at each other without end.
The sinister cudgel, Infinitely murderous,
Could whirl round your waist as quick as the wind,
The spear−catching staff,
Never yielding an opening,
Was irresistible, parrying to right and left.
On the one side the flags and banners fly,
On the other the camel drums roll.
Ten thousand heavenly generals in multiple encirclement;
A cave of monkey devils densely packed together.
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 77
Monstrous fogs and evil clouds cover the earth,
While the smoke of deadly battle rises to the sky.
Yesterday's fighting was bad enough;
Today's struggle is even worse.
The admirable skills of the Monkey King
Put Moksa to flight, utterly defeated.
After they had fought some fifty or sixty rounds, Huian's arm and shoulders were numbed and aching, and he
could resist the Great Sage no longer. Waving his staff in a feint, he turned away and ran. The Great Sage then
withdrew his monkey soldiers and encamped outside the gates of the cave.
The big and little heavenly soldiers at the gates of the other camp received Huian and let him go straight to the
headquarters, where he gasped and panted for breath as he said to the Four Heavenly Kings, Li the
Pagoda−bearer, and his brother Prince Nezha, "What a Great Sage! What a Great Sage! His magic powers are
too much for me. He beat me." Startled by this news, Heavenly King Li had a request for reinforcements
written and sent the Strong−arm Devil King and Prince Moksa up to Heaven to submit.
Not daring to waste a moment, the two messengers rushed out through the heaven−and−earth nets and
mounted their propitious clouds. A moment later they arrived outside the Hall of Universal Brightness, where
they greeted the Four Heavenly Teachers, who led them to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and handed up their
memorial. Prince Moksa, or Huian, did homage to the Bodhisattva, who asked him what he had found out.
"As you instructed me, I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit," reported Huian, "asked them to open the
gates of the heaven−and−earth net, saw my father, and told him of the orders you had given me. His Majesty
my father said that they fought against the Monkey King yesterday but did not capture a single monkey
spirit−−only tigers, leopards, lions, elephants and so on. While he was telling me this the Monkey King
demanded battle again, so your disciple fought some fifty or sixty rounds against him with my iron staff, but I
was no match for him. He beat me, and drove me back to the camp. This is why my father has sent me and the
Strong−arm Devil King up to Heaven to ask for reinforcements." The Bodhisattva lowered her head in deep
thought.
The Jade Emperor opened the memorial and saw that it contained a request for help. "This intolerable monkey
spirit has enough tricks to fight off a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers," he observed with a smile.
"Heavenly King Li has asked for reinforcements. Which heavenly soldiers should I send him?"
Before the words were out of his mouth, Guanyin put her hands together and said, "Do not worry, You
Majesty. I can recommend a god to capture this monkey."
"Which god?" the Jade Emperor asked, and the Bodhisattva replied, "Your Majesty's nephew, the Illustrious
Sage and True Lord Erlang, who is now living at Guanjiangkou in Guanzhou, enjoying the incense that the
lower beings burn to him. In the past he exterminated the Six Bogies. He has the Brothers of Plum Hill and
the twelve hundred straw−headed gods, and his magical powers are enormous. He will agree to be sent though
he would not obey a summons to come here, so Your Majesty might like to issue a decree ordering him to
take his troops to the rescue." The Jade Emperor then issued such a decree and sent the Strong−arm Devil
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 78
King to deliver it.
The devil king took the decree, mounted his cloud, and went straight to Guanjiangkou. He reached the temple
of the True Lord within an hour. When the demon judges guarding the gates went in to report that there was
an envoy from heaven standing outside with an imperial decree, Erlang went with the brothers to receive the
decree outside the gates, and incense was burned as he read.
The Great Sage Equaling Heaven, the monkey fiend of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, has rebelled.
Because he stole peaches, wine and pills while in Heaven and wrecked the Peach Banquet, we have
despatched a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and eighteen heaven−and−earth nets to surround the
mountain and force him to submit, but we have not yet succeeded. We do now therefore especially appoint
our worthy nephew and his sworn brothers to go to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and give their help in
eliminating him. When you succeed, large rewards and high office shall be yours.
Erlang was delighted. He told the envoy from Heaven to go back and report that the would be putting his
sword to the Emperor's service. We need not describe how the devil king reported back to Heaven.
The True Lord Erlang called the six sworn brothers of Plum Hill−−Marshals Kang, Zhang, Yao, and Li, and
Generals Quo Shen and Zhi Jian−−together before the hall. "The Jade Emperor has just ordered us to the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to subdue a monkey fiend," he said. "You are all coming with me."
The brothers were all eager to go, and mustering their divine troops they unleashed a gale wind. In an instant
they had crossed the Eastern Ocean, riding eagles and leading dogs, pulling their bows and drawing their
crossbows, and had reached the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.
Finding that the many layers of heaven−earth nets were impenetrable, Erlang shouted, "Listen, all you
generals in charge of the heaven−and−earth nets. I am the True Lord and the Illustrious Sage Erlang, and I
have been sent here by the Jade Emperor to capture the monkey fiend. Open the gates of the camp and let me
in at once." Each line of gods forming the nets let them through, and the four other Heavenly Kings and
Heavenly King Li all came to welcome him outside the headquarters. When the introductions were over he
asked how the fighting had gone, and the Heavenly Kings gave him a full account of what had happened.
"Now that I, the Little Sage, have come here I shall have to match a few transformations with him," said
Erlang with a smile. "I hope that all you gentlemen will maintain a close cordon with your heaven−and−earth
nets, but don't screen off the top of the mountain; then I'll be able to fight him. If he beats me I shan't need the
help of you gentlemen, as I have my brothers to support me; and if I beat him I won't have to trouble you to tie
him up as my brothers can do it. I would just like to ask Heavenly King Li to stand in the sky and operate this
fiend−detecting mirror. I'm worried that if he's beaten he may go and hide somewhere, so you will have to
give me a clear view of him and not let him get away." The Heavenly Kings stayed in the four quarters, and
all the heavenly soldiers were drawn up in their battle positions.
The True Lord Erlang went out at the head of the four marshals and the two generals−−making seven sworn
brothers with himself included−−to challenge the enemy to battle; and he ordered his other officers to defend
the camp firmly and keep the eagles and dogs under control. All the straw−headed gods acknowledged the
order. Erlang then went to the outside of the Water Curtain Cave, where he saw the monkey hordes neatly
drawn up in a coiled−dragon battle line; in the middle of the central corps stood a pole with a banner on it
reading "Great Sage Equaling Heaven."
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 79
"What business has that loathsome fiend to call himself the equal of Heaven?" Erlang asked; and the six
sworn brothers of Plum Hill replied, "Stop admiring him and challenge him to battle." When the junior
monkeys at the gate of their camp saw the True Lord Erlang they rushed back to report, whereupon the
Monkey King took his gold−banded cudgel, adjusted his golden armour, put on his cloud−walking shoes, felt
his golden helmet, and leapt out through the gates of the camp. He saw at first sight how cool and remarkable
Erlang looked, and how elegantly he was dressed. Indeed:
His bearing was refined, his visage noble,
His ears hung down to his shoulders, and his eyes shone.
The hat on his head had three peaks and phoenixes flying,
And his robe was of a pale goose−yellow.
His boots were lined with cloth of gold; dragons coiled round his socks;
His jade belt was decorated with the eight jewels,
At his waist was a bow, curved like the moon,
In his hand a double−edged trident.
His axe had split open Peach Mountain when he rescued his mother,
His bow had killed the twin phoenixes of Zongluo.
Widespread was his fame for killing the Eight Bogies,
And he had become one of Plum Hill's seven sages.
His heart was too lofty to acknowledge his relatives in Heaven;
In his pride he went back to be a god at Guanjiang.
He was the Merciful and Miraculous Sage of the red city,
Erlang, whose transformations were numberless.
When the Great Sage saw him he laughed with delight, raised his gold−banded cudgel, and shouted, "Where
are you from, little general, that you have the audacity to challenge me?"
"You must be blind, you wretch, if you can't recognize me. I am the nephew of the Jade Emperor, and my title
is Merciful and Miraculous King Erlang. I am here on imperial orders to arrest you, Protector of the Horses,
you rebel against Heaven, you reckless baboon."
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 80
"Now I remember who you are," replied the Great Sage. "Some years ago the Jade Emperor's younger sister
wanted to be mortal and came down to the lower world, where she married a Mr. Yang and gave birth to a
son, who split the Peach Mountain open with his axe. Is that who you are? I should really fling you a few
curses, but I've got no quarrel with you; and it would be a pity to kill you by hitting you with my cudgel. So
why don't you hurry back, young sir, and tell those four Heavenly Kings of yours to come out?"
When the True Lord Erlang heard this he burst out angrily, "Damned monkey! Where are your manners? Try
this blade of mine!" The Great Sage dodged the blow and instantly raised his gold−banded club to hit back.
There was a fine battle between the two of them:
The Merciful God Erlang,
The Great Sage Equaling Heaven:
One is the Handsome Monkey King, the proud deceiver of his enemies;
The other a true pillar, the unknown subduer.
When the two met
They were both in a fighting mood.
He who had no respect before
Today learned a sense of proportion.
The iron staff raced with the flying dragons,
The divine cudgel seemed like a dancing phoenix.
Parrying to the left, thrusting to the right,
Advancing to meet a blow, flashing behind.
The brothers of Plum Hill add to one side's might,
While the other has the four Stalwart Generals to transmit orders.
As the flags wave and the drums roll each side is as one;
Battle−cries and gongs raise everyone's morale.
The two steel blades each watch for their chance,
But neither leaves an opening as they come and go.
The gold−banded cudgel, the treasure from the sea,
Can fly and transform itself to win the victory.
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 81
A moment's delay and life is lost;
A single mistake will be the last.
After Erlang and the Great Sage had fought over three hundred rounds the outcome of the fight was still
undecided. Erlang braced, himself, and with a shake became ten thousand fathoms tall; in his hands his
two−bladed trident looked like the peaks of Mount Hua. His face was black, his fangs were long, and his hair
was bright red: he looked ferociously evil. He hacked at the Great Sage's head. The Great Sage, also resorting
to magic, gave himself a body as big as Erlang's and a face as frightening; and he raised his As−You−Will
gold−banded cudgel, which was now like the pillar of Heaven on the summit of the Kunlun Mountain, to
ward off Erlang's blow. This reduced the two ape field marshals Ma and Liu to such trembling terror that they
could no longer wave their banners, while the gibbon generals Seng and Ba were too scared to use their
swords. On the other side Kang, Zhang, Yao, Li, Guo Shen and Zhi Jian threw the straw−headed gods into an
assault on the Water Curtain Cave, with the dogs and eagles unleashed and their bows and crossbows drawn.
This attack put the four monkey generals to flight, and two or three thousand devils were captured. The
monkeys threw away their spears, tore off their armour, abandoned their swords and halberds, and fled
screaming. Some went up the mountain and some returned to the cave, like roosting birds frightened by an
owl, or stars scattered across the sky. That is all we have to say about the sworn brothers' victory.
The story goes on to tell how the True Lord Erlang and the Great Sage, having turned themselves into figures
on the scale of Heaven and Earth, were locked in battle when the Great Sage was suddenly appalled to notice
that the monkey fiends in his camp had scattered in terror. Putting off his magic appearance he broke away
and fled, his cudgel in his hand. Seeing him go, the True Lord Erlang hurried after him with long strides.
"Where are you going?" he asked. "If you surrender at once, your life will be spared." The Great Sage, who
had no heart left for the fight, was running as fast as he could. As he approached the mouth of the cave he
came up against Marshals Kang, Zhang, Yao and Li, as well as Generals Guo Shen and Zhi Jian, blocking his
way at the head of their armies.
"Where are you going, damned monkey?" they asked, and the Great Sage hastily squeezed his gold−banded
cudgel till it was the size of an embroidery needle and hid it in his ear. Then he shook himself, turned into a
sparrow, flew up into a tree, and perched on one of its branches.
The six sworn brothers looked for him very hard but could find him nowhere, so they all shouted in unison,
"The monkey fiend has escaped, the monkey fiend has escaped."
As they were shouting the True Lord Erlang arrived and asked them, "Brothers, where had you chased him to
when he disappeared?"
"We had him surrounded here just now, but he vanished." Erlang opened his phoenix eyes till they were quite
round and looked about him. He saw that the Great Sage had changed himself into a sparrow and was
perching on a branch; so he put off his magical appearance, threw down his divine trident, and took the pellet
bow from his waist. Then he shook himself, changed into a kite, spread his wings, and swooped in to attack.
As soon as the Great Sage saw this he took off and turned himself into a big cormorant, soaring up into the
sky. Erlang saw him, and with a quick shake of his feathers and a twist of his body he transformed himself
into a crane and pierced the clouds as he tried to catch him. The Great Sage landed on a mountain stream and,
changing into a fish, plunged into the water. Erlang, who had pursued him to the bank of the stream, could see
no trace of him.
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 82
"That macaque must have gone into the water and changed himself into some kind of fish or shrimp," he
thought. "I'll transform myself again, then I'll get him." He turned into a fish−hawk and soared above the
lower reaches of the stream and the first waves of the sea. He waited there for a time. Meanwhile the Great
Sage, who was in the form of a fish, swam with the stream until he noticed a bird flying above him. It was
quite like a blue kite, except that its feathers were not blue; it was quite like an egret, but it had no crest on its
head; and it was quite like a stork, but its legs were not red.
"That must be what Erlang turned himself into while waiting for me," he thought, turned round quickly, and
went away.
"The fish who turned round," thought Erlang when he saw this, "is like a carp but its tail isn't red; it's like a
mandarin fish, but I can't see the pattern on its scales; it's like a snakehead, but without a star on its head; and
like a bream, but it has no needles on its gills. Why did it turn round the moment it saw me? It must be that
monkey transformed." He swooped down and snapped at the Great Sage with his beak. The Great Sage leapt
out of the water, turned into a water−snake, swam to the bank, and slid into the grass. Failing to catch the fish
in his beak, Erlang saw a snake jump out of the water and realized it was the Great Sage. He changed himself
at once into a red−crested grey crane, and stretched out his long beak that was like a pair of pointed pincers to
eat up the water−snake. The snake gave a jump and became a bustard standing stiffly on a
smartweed−covered bank. When Erlang saw that he had turned himself into so low a creature−−for the
bustard is the lowest and lewdest of birds, not caring whether it mates with phoenix, eagle or crow−−he kept
his distance, reverted to his own body, went away to fetch and load his pellet bow, and knocked him flying
with a single shot.
The Great Sage seized the chance as he rolled down the precipice to crouch there and turn himself into a
temple to a local god. He opened his mouth wide to look like the entrance to the temple and turned his teeth
into the doors; he made his tongue into a statue of a god and his eyes into windows and lattice. He could not
tuck his tail away, so he stuck it up behind him as a flagpole. When Erlang came to the foot of the precipice
he could not see the bustard he had shot over, and anxiously opening his phoenix eyes he looked carefully
around and saw a temple with its flagpole at the back.
"It must be that monkey over there," he observed with a smile. "He's trying to fool me again. I've seen temples
before, but never one with the flagpole at the back. I'm sure it is that beast up to his tricks again. If he'd
managed to lure me in, he'd have been able to get me with a single bite. Of course I won't go in. I'll smash his
windows in with my fist, then I'll kick his door down."
"Vicious, really vicious," thought the Great Sage with horror when he heard him say this. "Those doors are
my teeth, and the windows are my eyes; and if he smashes my teeth and bashes in my eyes, what sort of a
state will that leave me in?" With a tiger leap he disappeared into the sky.
The True Lord Erlang rushed around wildly, but he could only see his six sworn brothers, who crowded round
him and asked, "Elder brother, did you catch the Great Sage?"
"That monkey turned himself into a temple to fool me," he replied with a laugh. "Just when I was going to
smash his windows and kick in his door he gave a jump and vanished without a trace. Strange, very strange."
They were all astonished, and though they looked all around they could see no sign of him.
"Brothers, you patrol this area while I go to look for him above," said Erlang, and with a quick jump he was
riding a cloud in mid−air.
When he saw Heavenly King Li holding high the fiend−detecting mirror and standing with Nezha at the edge
of a cloud, the True Lord asked, "Your Heavenly Majesty, have you seen that Monkey King?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 83
"He hasn't come up here−−I've been keeping a lookout for him with this mirror," the Heavenly King replied.
The True Lord Erlang then told him how he had used transformations and magic to capture the monkey
hordes.
"He changed into a temple," Erlang went on, "but got away just when I was going to hit him." On hearing this,
Heavenly King Li turned the fiend−detecting mirror in all four directions, then said with a laugh, "Hurry
away, True Lord, hurry away. The monkey made himself invisible to get through the encirclement, and he's
gone to your place, Guanjiangkou." Erlang took his divine trident and returned to Guanjiangkou in pursuit.
The Great Sage had already arrived there, changed himself into the likeness of the god Erlang with a shake of
his body, put away his cloud, and gone into the temple. The demon judges did not realize who he really was,
so they all kowtowed to welcome him. He took his seat in the middle of the temple, and inspected the
offerings: the beef, mutton and pork presented by one Li Hu, the ex−voto promised by a Zhang Long, the
letter from a Zhao Jia asking for a son, and one Qian Bing's prayer for recovery from illness. As he was
looking round it was announced that another Lord Erlang had arrived. All the demon judges hurried to look,
and they were all astonished.
The True Lord Erlang asked, "Has a so−called Great Sage Equaling Heaven been here?"
"We haven't seen any Great Sages," they replied, "only another god who's looking around inside."
The True Lord rushed in through the gates, and as soon as the Great Sage saw him he reverted to his own
appearance and said, "There's no point in shouting, sir. This temple's mine now."
The True Lord raised his double−bladed trident and swung at the Monkey King's head, but the Monkey King
dodged the blow by magic, took his embroidery needle, shook it till it was as thick as a bowl, and rushed
forward to meet the attack. Shouting and yelling, they fought their way out through the gates, and went on
fighting through the mists and clouds all the way back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. The Four
Heavenly Kings and all their soldiers were so alarmed that they kept an even tighter guard. Marshals Kang
and Zhang and the others came to meet the True Lord, and combined their efforts to surround the Handsome
Monkey King. But of this no more for now.
After the Strong−arm Demon King had sent the True Lord Erlang and his six sworn brothers with their troops
to capture the fiend, he had gone back to Heaven to report. He found the Jade Emperor, the Bodhisattva
Guanyin, the Queen Mother and all his immortal ministers in conference.
"Although Erlang has joined the fight, we have had no reports on it all day," the Jade Emperor said.
Guanyin put her hands together and replied, "May I suggest that Your Majesty go out through the Southern
Gate of Heaven with Lord Lao Zi to see for yourself what is happening."
"A good idea," said the Emperor, and he went by chariot with Lao Zi, the Queen Mother, and all the immortal
ministers to the Southern Gate of Heaven. Here they were met by a number of heavenly soldiers and
strongmen. When the gates were opened and they looked into the distance they saw that the heavenly hosts
were spread all around in a net; Heavenly King Li and Nezha were standing in mid−air with the
fiend−detecting mirror, and Erlang was struggling with the Great Sage within the encircling ring.
The Bodhisattva addressed Lao Zi and asked, "What do you think of the god Erlang I recommended? He
really does have divine powers. He's just got that Great Sage cornered, and all he has to do now is to catch
him. If I give him a little help now he will certainly be able to do it."
Journey to the West
Chapter 6 84
"What weapon would you use, Bodhisattva? How could you help him?" Lao Zi asked.
"I'll drop that pure vase of willow twigs on the monkey's head. Even if it doesn't kill him it will knock him off
balance and enable the Little Sage to catch him."
"That vase of yours is made of porcelain," Lao Zi replied, "and if you hit the target that will be fine. But if it
were to miss his head and smash into his iron club, it would be shattered. Just hold your hand while I give him
a little help."
"What sort of weapon do you have?" the Bodhisattva asked, and Lord Lao Zi replied, "I've got one all right."
He pulled up his sleeve and took a bracelet off his right arm.
"This weapon," he said, "is made of tempered steel to which I have added the magic elixir. It preserves my
miraculous essence, can transform itself, is proof against fire and water, and can snare anything. One of its
names is Diamond Jade and the other is Diamond Noose. When I went out through the Han Pass some years
ago to turn into a foreigner and become a Buddha, I have a great deal to thank it for. It's the best protection at
any time. Just watch while I throw it down and hit him."
As soon as he had finished speaking he threw it down from outside the heavenly gate, and it fell into the camp
on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, hitting the Monkey King neatly on the head. The Monkey King was too
preoccupied with fighting the seven sages to notice this weapon falling on him from heaven, and when it
struck him on the forehead he lost his balance and stumbled, then picked himself up and started to run. The
slim dog of the god Erlang caught him up and bit him in the calf, bringing him down again. As he lay on the
ground he cursed at the dog.
"You don't bother your own master, damn you; why pick on me to bite?" He rolled over and tried
unsuccessfully to get up, but the seven sages all held him down, roped him up, and put a sickle−shaped blade
round his collar−bone to prevent him from making any more transformations.
Lord Lao Zi then recovered his Diamond Jade and invited the Jade Emperor, Guanyin, the Queen Mother, and
all the immortal ministers to return to the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Down below, Heavenly King Li and the
four other Heavenly Kings assembled their troops and pulled up the stockade. They went over to congratulate
the Little Sage and said, "It was all thanks to you, Little Sage."
"No, it was thanks to the great blessings of His Celestial Majesty and the might of all the gods−−it was
nothing I did," replied the Little Sage.
"No time to talk now, elder brother," said the four marshals Kang, Zhang, Yao, and Li. "Let's take this wretch
up to Heaven to see the Jade Emperor and ask what is to be done with him."
"Worthy brothers," Erlang replied, "you never received any heavenly commission, so it would not be right for
you to see the Jade Emperor. The heavenly soldiers can escort him while I go up there with the Heavenly
Kings to report back. You should comb this mountain with your troops, and when you've finished go back to
Guanjiangkou. When I've asked for our rewards, I'll come back and we can celebrate together." The four
marshals and the two generals accepted their orders, and the rest mounted their clouds and went to Heaven
triumphantly singing victory songs. Before long they were outside the Hall of Universal Brightness. The
heavenly teachers reported to the throne that the Four Great Heavenly Kings and the rest of them had captured
the monkey devil, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, and were now waiting to be summoned. The Jade
Emperor then issued an edict ordering the Strong−arm Demon King and the heavenly soldiers to march him to
the Demon−beheading Tower, where the wretch was to have his body chopped to mincemeat. Goodness!

Chapter 7
The Great Sage Escapes from the Eight Trigrams Furnace
The Mind−Ape Is Fixed Beneath Five Elements Mountain
Wealth and honour, glory and fame,
Are predetermined by fate:
No one should act against conscience to covet any of them.
Far−going and deep
Are the good results of true enlightenment and loyalty.
Heaven punishes all wild and wicked deeds
If not at once then later on.
Ask the Lord of the East the reason why
Disasters now strike him.
It is because his ambition was high, his plans far−reaching,
He did not respect authority, and he smashed convention.
The story goes on to tell how the Great Sage Equaling Heaven was escorted by the hosts of heavenly soldiers
to the Demon−beheading Tower and tied to the Demon−subduing Pillar. They hacked at him with sabres,
sliced at him with axes, lunged at him with spears and cut at him with swords, but they were unable to inflict a
single wound on him. The Southern Dipper angrily ordered all the gods of the Department of Fire to set him
alight and burn him up, but he would not ignite. He told the gods of the Department of Thunder to nail
splinters of thunder into him, but however hard they tried they could not harm a hair of his body. The
Strong−arm Demon King and the rest of them then reported this to the throne.
"Your Majesty," they said, "this Great Sage has learned somewhere or other how to protect himself by magic.
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 86
Although your subjects have hacked at him with sabres, sliced at him with axes, struck at him with thunder
and tried to burn him with fire, we have not been able to harm a hair of his body. What are we to do?"
"How can we deal with a wretch like this?" the Jade Emperor asked, and the Lord Lao Zi replied to this in a
memorial: "That monkey has eaten the peaches of immortality, drunk the imperial liquor, and stolen the pills
of elixir. He swallowed those five gourds of pills of mine, fresh ones and mature ones alike. Now we have
used the fire of samadhi on him, which has tempered his body and made it a diamond one that cannot be
harmed. The best course would be to let me take him and put him in my Eight Trigrams Furnace, where I can
refine out my elixir with the civil and martial fire and reduce him to ashes at the same time. The Jade Emperor
then ordered the Six Dings and the Six Jias to untie him and hand him over to the Lord Lao Zi, who took him
away in obedience to the imperial decree. At the same time the Jade Emperor summoned the Illustrious Sage
Erlang to his presence and rewarded him with a hundred golden flowers, a hundred jars of imperial liquor, a
hundred pills of elixir, rare jewels, lustrous pearls, brocade, embroidery, and other gifts to share with his
sworn brothers. The True Lord Erlang thanked him for his bounty and returned to Guanjiangkou.
When he reached the Tushita Palace, Lord Lao Zi had the Great Sage untied, took the hook from his
collar−bone, pushed him into the Eight Trigrams Furnace, and ordered the priests in charge of it and the
fire−boys to fan the fire up to refine him. Now this furnace was made up of the Eight Trigrams−−Qian, Kan,
Gen, Zhen, Sun, Li, Kun, and Dui−−so he squeezed himself into the "Palace of Sun," as Sun was the wind,
and where there was wind there could be no fire. All that happened was that the wind stirred up the smoke,
which made both his eyes red and left him somewhat blind with the illness called "fire eyes with golden
pupils."
Time soon passed, and without him realizing it the seven times seven, or forty−nine, days had passed, and
Lord Lao Zi's fire had reached the required temperature and burned for long enough. One day the furnace was
opened for the elixir to be taken out. The Great Sage, who was shielding his eyes with both hands and wiping
away his tears, heard a noise at the top of the furnace. He looked hard and saw daylight; and, unable to stand
being in there a moment longer, leapt out of the furnace, kicked it over with a crash, and was off. In the
ensuing chaos the fire−boys, the keepers of the furnace, the Dings and the Jias all tried to grab him, but he
knocked them all down. He was like a white−browed tiger gone berserk, a single−horned dragon raving mad.
Lord Lao Zi rushed up to seize him, but was thrown head over heels as the Great Sage freed himself. He took
the As−You−Will cudgel from his ear, and shook it in the wind till it was thick as a bowl, and once more
created total chaos in the Palace of Heaven, not caring in the least what he did. He laid about him to such
effect that the Nine Bright Shiners shut their windows and doors, and not a sign was to be seen of the Four
Heavenly Kings.
Marvellous monkey spirit! As the poem has it,
His primordial body matches an earlier heaven,
Completely natural throughout ten thousand ages;
Vast and passive, blended with the Great Monad;
Always immobile, known as the Prime Mystery.
After so much refining in the furnace he is not lead or mercury;
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 87
Having lived long outside the ordinary he is a natural Immortal.
His changes are inexhaustible, and still he has more,
So say nothing about the Three Refuges or Five Abstentions.
Another poem says:
A single point of magic light can fill the whole of space;
Likewise that staff of his:
Longer or shorter, depending on his needs,
Upright or horizontal, it can shrink or grow.
Yet another poem runs:
To the ape's immortal body is matched a human mind:
That the mind is an ape is deeply meaningful.
It was quite true that the Great Sage equaled Heaven:
The appointment as Protector of the Horse showed no discernment.
Horse and ape together make mind and thought;
Bind them tightly together, and do not seek elsewhere.
When all phenomena are reduced to truth they follow a single pattern;
Like the Tathagatha reaching nirvana under the two trees.
This time the Monkey King made no distinctions between high and humble as he laid about him to East and
West with his iron club. Not a single god opposed him. He fought his way into the Hall of Universal
Brightness outside the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where the Kingly Spirit Officer, the lieutenant of the Helpful
Sage and True Lord, fortunately was on duty. When he saw the Great Sage charging around he took up his
golden mace and went forward to resist him.
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 88
"Where are you going, damned monkey?" he asked. "If you go wild you'll have me to deal with." The Great
Sage was not in a position to argue with him, so he raised his cudgel to strike him. The Spirit Officer lifted his
mace and advanced to meet him. It was a fine fight:
Great was the fame of the brave and loyal officer,
Evil the name of the rebel who bullied Heaven.
The low one and the good one were well matched;
Valiant heroes fighting each other.
Vicious the iron cudgel,
Quick the golden mace.
Both were straight, merciless, and terrible.
One of them is a deity formed from the Great Monad's thunder;
The other is the monkey spirit, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.
With golden mace or iron cudgel each is a master;
Both are weapons from the palaces of the gods.
Today they show their might in the Hall of Miraculous Mist,
A wonderful display of courage and skill.
One in his folly wanting to capture the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull,
The other exerting all his strength to support the world of the gods.
The fight is too hard to allow the use of magic,
As mace and cudgel struggle without result.
As they fought together without either of them emerging as victor, the True Lord sent an officer with a
message to the Thunder Palace ordering the thirty−six thunder generals to surround the Great Sage. Although
they all fought with the utmost ferocity, the Great Sage was not in the least frightened, and parried and
blocked to left and right with his As−You−Will cudgel, resisting his opponents in front and behind. Before
long he found that the pressure was too great from the sabres, spears, swords, halberds, clubs, maces,
claws−and−ropes, hammer, pole−axes, battle−axes, grabs, pennoned hooks, and moon−shaped bills of the
thunder generals; so he shook himself and grew three heads and six arms. Then he shook his As−You−Will
cudgel and changed it into three cudgels, and wielding the three cudgels in his six hands he flew round and
round inside the encirclement like a spinning wheel. None of the thunder generals could get anywhere near
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 89
him. Indeed,
Perfectly round,
Gleaming bright,
How can men learn to live for ever?
He can enter fire without being burned,
And go in the water but not be drowned.
He is as bright as a Mani pearl,
Swords and spears cannot harm him.
He is capable of good,
And capable of evil:
When faced with the choice between good and evil he might do either.
If he is good he becomes a Buddha or an Immortal,
If bad, he grows fur and horns.
With his boundless transformations he wrecked the Heavenly palace,
Nor can thunder generals and divine troops take him.
Although the gods had the Great Sage cornered, they were unable to get near him. The noise of the shouting
and the fighting had already alarmed the Jade Emperor, who ordered the Miracle Official Youyi to go to the
West with the Helpful Sage and True Lord and ask the Buddha to subdue him.
When these two sages received the order they went to the wonderful land of the Miraculous Mountain, where
they offered their greetings to the Four Vajrapanis and Eight Bodhisattvas before the Thunder Monastery and
asked them to pass on their massage. The gods went to the foot of the lotus seat to inform the Tathagata, who
invited the two sages to his presence. When the sages had performed the threefold obeisance to the Buddha
they stood in attendance below the throne.
"Why has the Jade Emperor troubled you two sages to come here?" asked the Buddha.
"A monkey," they reported, "who was born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, has used his magic powers
to unite all the monkeys and throw the world into confusion. The Jade Emperor sent down an edict of amnesty
and appointed him Protector of the Horses, but this was not good enough for him, so he left Heaven again.
When heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha were unsuccessful in their attempt to capture him the Jade Emperor
sent down another amnesty with his appointment as a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'. At first this appointment
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 90
was purely nominal, but later he was told to look after the Peach Orchard. But he stole the peaches and then
went to the Jade Pool where he stole the delicacies and the liquor and wrecked the banquet. In his drunkenness
he staggered into the Tushita Palace, stole Lord Lao Zi's pills of immortality, and left Heaven again. The Jade
Emperor sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops, but they were still unable to subdue him. Then Guanyin
recommended the True Lord Erlang and his sworn brothers to go after the monkey, and he used many a
transformation until he was finally able to capture the monkey after the Lord Lao Zi hit him with his Diamond
Jade. The monkey was then taken to the imperial presence, and the order for his execution was given. But
although he was hacked at with sabres, chopped at with axes, burned with fire, and struck with thunder, none
of this did him any damage; so Lord Lao Zi requested permission to take him away and refine him with fire.
But when the cauldron was opened after forty−nine days he jumped out of the Eight Trigrams Furnace, routed
the heavenly troops, and went straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness in front of the Hall of Miraculous
Mist. Here he has been stopped and engaged in fierce combat by the Kingly Spirit Officer, the lieutenant of
the Helpful Sage and True Lord Erlang, thunder generals have been sent there to encircle him; but no one has
been able to get close to him. In this crisis the Jade Emperor makes a special appeal to you, the Tathagata, to
save his throne."
On hearing this the Tathagata said to the assembled Bodhisattvas, "You stay here quietly in this dharma hall
and behave yourselves in your seats of meditation while I go to deal with the demon and save the throne."
Telling the Venerable Ananda and the Venerable Kasyapa to accompany him, the Tathagata left the Thunder
Monastery and went straight to the gate of the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where his ears were shaken by the
sound of shouting as the thirty−six thunder generals surrounded the Great Sage. The Buddha issued a decree
that ran: "Tell the thunder generals to stop fighting, open up their camp, and call on that Great Sage to come
out, so that I may ask him what divine powers he has."
The generals then withdrew, whereupon the Great Sage put away his magic appearance and came forward in
his own body. He was in a raging temper as he asked, "Where are you from? You are a good man. You've got
nerve, stopping the fighting and questioning me!"
"I am the Venerable Sakyamuni from the Western Land of Perfect Bliss," replied the Buddha with a smile. "I
have heard of your wild and boorish behavior, and of your repeated rebellions against Heaven, and I would
like to know where you were born, when you found the Way, and why you have been so ferocious."
"I am," the Great Sage said,
"A miracle−working Immortal born of Heaven and Earth,
An old ape from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.
My home is in the Water Curtain Cave,
I sought friends and teachers, and became aware of the Great Mystery.
"I have practiced many a method for obtaining eternal life,
Infinite are the transformations I have learned.
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 91
That is why I found the mortal world too cramped,
And decided to live in the Jade Heaven.
"None can reign forever in the Hall of Miraculous Mist;
Kings throughout history have had to pass on their power.
The strong should be honoured−−he should give way to me:
This is the only reason I wage my heroic fight."
The Buddha laughed mockingly.
"You wretch! You are only a monkey spirit and you have the effrontery to want to grab the throne of the Jade
Emperor. He has trained himself since childhood, and suffered hardship for one thousand, seven hundred and
fifty kalpas. Each kalpa is 129,600 years, so you can work out for yourself how long it has taken him to be
able to enjoy this great and infinite Way. But you are a beast who has only just become a man for the first
time. How dare you talk so big? You're not human, not even human! I'll shorten your life−span. Accept my
teaching at once and stop talking such nonsense! Otherwise you'll be in for trouble and your life will very
shortly be over; and that will be so much the worse for your original form too."
"Although he has trained himself for a long time, ever since he was a child, he still has no right to occupy this
place for ever," the Great Sage said. "As the saying goes, 'Emperors are made by turn; next year it may be me.'
If he can be persuaded to move out and make Heaven over to me, that'll be fine. But if he doesn't abdicate in
my favour I'll most certainly make things hot for him, and he'll never know peace and quiet again."
"What have you got, besides immortality and the ability to transform yourself, that gives you the nerve to try
to seize the Heavenly Palace?" the Buddha asked.
"I can do many tricks indeed," the Great Sage replied. "I can perform seventy−two transformations, and I can
preserve my youth for ten thousand kalpas. I can ride a somersault cloud that takes me thirty−six thousand
miles at a single jump. So why shouldn't I sit on the throne of Heaven?"
"I'll have a wager with you then," said the Buddha. "If you're clever enough to get out of my right hand with a
single somersault, you will be the winner, and there will be no more need for weapons or fighting: I shall
invite the Jade Emperor to come and live in the West and abdicate the Heavenly Palace to you. But if you
can't get out of the palm of my hand you will have to go down to the world below as a devil and train yourself
for several more kalpas before coming to argue about it again."
When he heard this offer the Great Sage smiled to himself and thought, "This Buddha is a complete idiot. I
can cover thirty−six thousand miles with a somersault, so how could I fail to jump out of the palm of his hand,
which is less than a foot across?"
With this in his mind he asked eagerly, "Do you guarantee that yourself?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 92
"Yes, yes," the Buddha replied, and he stretched out his right hand, which seemed to be about the size of a
lotus leaf. Putting away his As−You−Will cudgel, the Great Sage summoned up all his divine powers, jumped
into the palm of the Buddha's hand, and said, "I'm off." Watch him as he goes like a streak of light and
disappears completely. The Buddha, who was watching him with his wise eyes, saw the Monkey King
whirling forward like a windmill and not stopping until he saw five flesh−pink pillars topped by dark vapours.
"This is the end of the road," he said, "so now I'll go back. The Buddha will be witness, and the Hall of
Miraculous Mist will be mine." Then he thought again, "Wait a moment. I'll leave my mark here to prove my
case when I talk to the Buddha." He pulled out a hair, breathed on it with his magic breath, and shouted
"Change." It turned into a writing brush dipped in ink, and with it he wrote THE GREAT SAGE EQUALING
HEAVEN WAS HERE in big letters on the middle pillar. When that was done he put the hair back on, and,
not standing on his dignity, made a pool of monkey piss at the foot of the pillar. Then he turned his somersault
round and went back to where he had started from.
"I went, and now I'm back. Tell the Jade Emperor to hand the Heavenly Palace over to me," he said, standing
in the Buddha's palm.
"I've got you, you piss−spirit of a monkey," roared the Buddha at him. "You never left the palm of my hand."
"You're wrong there," the Great Sage replied. "I went to the farthest point of Heaven, where I saw five
flesh−pink pillars topped by dark vapours. I left my mark there: do you dare come and see it with me?"
"There's no need to go. Just look down." The Great Sage looked down with his fire eyes with golden pupils to
see the words "The Great Sage Equaling Heaven Was Here" written on the middle finger of the Buddha's right
hand. The stink of monkey−piss rose from the fold at the bottom of the finger.
"What a thing to happen," exclaimed the Great Sage in astonishment. "I wrote this on one of the pillars
supporting the sky, so how can it be on his finger now? He must have used divination to know what I was
going to do. I don't believe it. I refuse to believe it! I'll go there and come back again."
The dear Great Sage hurriedly braced himself to jump, but the Buddha turned his hand over and pushed the
Monkey King out through the Western Gate of Heaven. He turned his five fingers into a mountain chain
belonging to the elements Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, renamed them the Five Elements Mountain,
and gently held him down.
All the thunder gods and the disciples Ananda and Kasyapa put their hands together to praise the Buddha:
"Wonderful, wonderful,
An egg learned to be a man,
Cultivated his conduct, and achieved the Way.
Heaven had been undisturbed for the thousand kalpas,
Until one day the spirits and gods were scattered.
"The rebel against Heaven, wanting high position,
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 93
Insulted Immortals, stole the pills, and destroyed morality.
Today his terrible sins are being punished,
Who knows when he will be able to rise again?"
When he had eliminated the monkey fiend the Buddha told Ananda and Kasyapa to return with him to the
Western paradise. At that moment Tian Peng and Tian You hurried out of the Hall of Miraculous Mist to say,
"We beg the Tathagata to wait a moment as the Jade Emperor's chariot is coming."
The Buddha turned round and looked up, and an instant later he saw an eight−splendour imperial chariot and a
nine−shining jeweled canopy appear to the sound of strange and exquisite music, and the chanting of
countless sacred verses. Precious flowers were scattered and incense was burned.
The Jade Emperor went straight up to the Buddha and said, "We are deeply indebted to the great Buddha's
powers for wiping out the demon, and we hope that the Tathagata will spend a day here so that we may invite
all the Immortals to a feast of thanksgiving."
The Buddha did not dare refuse, so putting his hands together he replied, "This old monk only came here in
obedience to Your Celestial Majesty's command. What magic powers can I pretend to? This was all due to the
wonderful good fortune of Your Celestial Majesty and the other gods. How could I possibly allow you to
thank me?"
The Jade Emperor then ordered all the gods of the Department of Thunder to split up and invite the Three
Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, the Five Ancients, the Six Superintendents, the Seven Main Stars, the Eight
Points of the Compass, the Nine Bright Shiners, the Ten Chiefs, the Thousand Immortals, and the Ten
Thousand Sages to a banquet to thank the Buddha for his mercy. Then he ordered the Four Great Heavenly
Teachers and the Nine Heavenly Maidens to open the golden gates of the jade capital, and Palace of the Great
Mystery, and the Tong Yang Jade Palace, invite the Tathagata to take his seat on the Throne of the Seven
Precious Things, arrange the places for all the different groups of guests, and set out the dragon liver, phoenix
bone−marrow, jade liquor, and magic peaches.
Before long the Original Celestial Jade Pure One, the High Celestial Precious Pure One, the Heavenly
Celestial Pure One of the Way, the True Lords of the Five Humors, the Star Lords of the Five Constellations,
the Three Officers, the Four Sages, the Left Assistant, the Right Support, the Heavenly Kings, Nezha, and the
whole of space responded to the invitations that had been sent out magically. Their standards and canopies
came two by two as they brought shining pearls, rare jewels, fruit of longevity, and exotic flowers, and
presented them to the Buddha with bows.
"We thank the Tathagata for subduing the monkey fiend with his infinite powers. His Celestial Majesty has
asked us all to come to his banquet to express our thanks. We beg the Tathagata to give this banquet a title."
The Buddha accepted this commission and said, "Since you want a name for it, we could call it the 'Banquet
to Celebrate Peace in Heaven.'"
"Splendid, 'Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven,' splendid," exclaimed all the Immortals with one voice, and
then they all sat down in their places, put flowers in their hair, and played the lyre. It was indeed a splendid
banquet, and here are some verses to prove it:
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 94
The Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven far surpasses
The Banquet of Peaches that the monkey wrecked.
Radiance shines from dragon flags and imperial chariots;
Auspicious vapours float above streamers and symbols of office.
Melodious the fairy music and mysterious songs;
Loud sound the tones of phoenix flute and pipe of jade
The rarest of perfumes waft around the Immortals, assembled calm in the sky.
To congratulate the court on Pacifying the Universe.
When the Immortals were all enjoying the feast the Queen Mother and a group of fairies, immortal beauties,
and houris, floated through the air as they danced towards the Buddha, and after paying her respects the
Queen Mother said, "My Peach Banquet was ruined by that monkey fiend, and this Banquet to Celebrate
Peace in Heaven is being given because the Tathagata has used his great powers to chain down the evil
monkey. Having nothing else with which to express my gratitude, I have picked a number of peaches of
immortality with my own pure hands as an offering." They were
Half red, half green, sweet−smelling beauties
Growing every ten thousand years from immortal roots.
The peaches of Wulingyuan seem laughable:
How can they compare with those of Heaven?
Purple−veined and tender, rare even in the sky,
Yellow−stoned, and matchless on earth for their sweetness.
They are able to adapt the body and make it live for ever;
Those lucky enough to eat them are no ordinary beings.
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 95
The Buddha put his hands together to thank the Queen Mother, who instructed the fairies and houris to sing
and dance again, and their performance met with the praises of the whole assembly. Indeed:
Misty heavenly incense filled the room;
A chaos of heavenly petals and flowers.
Great is the splendour of the jade city and golden gates,
Priceless the strange treasures and rare jewels.
Two by two, coeval with Heaven,
Pair by pair, outliving ten thousand kalpas:
Even if land and sea changed places
They would not be astonished or alarmed.
Soon after the Queen Mother had ordered the fairies and houris to sing and dance, and when wine cups and
chopsticks were weaving to and fro, suddenly
A strange scent reached their noses,
Startling the stars and constellations in the hall.
Immortals and the Buddha put down their cups,
Each of them raising their heads to look.
An old man appeared in the middle of the Milky Way
Holding a sacred mushroom.
His gourd contains ten−thousand−year elixir.
On the sacred rolls his name is written Eternal Life.
In his cave Heaven and Earth are free.
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 96
In his bottle Sun and Moon were created.
As he wanders around the Four Seas in pure idleness
Taking his ease in the Ten Continents, enjoying the bustle.
When he went to Peach Banquets he often got drunk
But when he came round, the moon was as bright as ever.
A long head, big ears and a short body,
Known as Longevity from the Southern Pole.
The Star of Longevity had arrived. When he had made his greetings to the Jade Emperor and the Buddha he
made a speech of thanks.
"When I heard that the monkey fiend had been taken by the Lord Lao Zi to his Tushita palace to be refined I
thought that this was bound to restore peace," he said, "and I never expected he would rebel again. Happily
the demon was quelled by the Tathagata, and so when I heard that this feast was being given to thank him I
came at once. As I have nothing else to offer I have brought with me purple magic mushrooms, jasper herbs,
greenish jade lotus−root, and golden pills of immortality: these I humbly present." The poem says
Offering the jade louts−root and golden pills to Sakyamuni,
To give him as many years as the grains of sand of the Ganges.
Peace and eternal joy decorate the Three Vehicles;
Prosperity and eternal life make the nine grades of immortals glorious.
Within the gate of No−Phenomena the true Law rules;
Above the Heaven of Nothingness is his immortal home.
Heaven and Earth both call him their ancestor,
His golden body provides blessings and long life.
The Buddha happily accepted his thanks, and after the Star of Longevity had taken his place the wine−cups
started to circulate once more. Then the Bare−foot Immortal appeared, kowtowed to the Jade Emperor, and
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 97
thanked the Buddha.
"I am deeply grateful to you for subduing the monkey fiend with your divine powers. As I have nothing else
with which to express my respect, I offer you two magic pears and a number of fire−dates."
Sweet are the Bare−foot Immortal's pears and dates,
And long will be the life of the Buddha to whom they are offered.
The lotus seat of the seven treasures is as firm as a mountain,
His thousand−golden−flower throne is as gorgeous as brocade.
Coeval with Heaven and Earth−−this is no lie;
It is true that his blessings are greater than a flood.
His Western Paradise of leisure and bliss
Truly provides all the long life and blessings one could hope.
The Buddha thanked him too, and telling Ananda and Kasyapa to collect together all the offerings he went
over to the Jade Emperor to thank him for the banquet. When all the guests were thoroughly drunk the
Miraculous Patrolling Officer reported that the Great Sage had poked his head out.
"It doesn't matter," the Buddha said, producing from his sleeve a strip of paper on which were written the
golden words Om mani padme hum. He gave this piece of paper to Ananda and told him to stick it on the
summit of the mountains. The Venerable Ananda took it through the gates of Heaven and pasted it firmly to a
square boulder on the top of the Five Elements Mountain. When this was done the mountain sank roots and
joined up all its seams. The Monkey King was still able to breathe and he could still stick his hands out and
move them. Ananda went back to Heaven and reported that he had pasted the paper in place.
The Buddha then took his leave of the Jade Emperor and all the other deities. When he and his two disciples
had gone out through the gates of Heaven his merciful heart moved him to chant a spell ordering a local
tutelary god and the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions to live on the mountain and keep guard over
him. When he was hungry they were to feed him iron pellets, and when he was thirsty they were to give him
molten copper to drink. When the time of his punishment was over, someone would come and rescue him.
Indeed:
The monkey fiend was bold enough to rebel against Heaven,
But was subdued by the Tathagata's hand.
Journey to the West
Chapter 7 98
He endures the months and years, drinking molten copper for his thirst,
And blunts his hunger on iron pellets, serving his time.
Suffering the blows of Heaven, he undergoes torment,
Yet even in the bleakest time a happy fate awaits.
If some hero is ready to struggle for him,
One year he will go to the West in the service of the Buddha.
Another poem goes:
His great power grew as he humbled the mighty,
He used his wicked talents to subdue tigers and dragons.
He stole the peaches and wine as he wandered round Heaven,
Was graciously given office in the Jade Capital.
When his wickedness went too far his body suffered,
But his roots of goodness were not severed, and his breath still rose.
He will escape from the hand of the Buddha,
And wait till the Tang produces a saintly monk.
It you don't know in what month of what year his sufferings ended, listen to the explanation in the next
installment.

If you try to ask about the dhyana
Journey to the West

Or investigate the innumerable
You will waste your life and achieve nothing.
Polishing bricks to make mirrors,
Or piling up snow to turn it into grain−−
However many years have you wasted like that?
A hair can contain an ocean,
A mustard−seed can hold a mountain,
And the golden Kasyapa only smiles.
When you are awakened you will surpass the Ten Stages and the Three Vehicles,
And stop the four kinds of birth and the six types of reincarnation.
Who has ever heard, before the cliff of thoughts extinguished,
Under the tree that has no shadow,
The sound of the cuckoo in a spring dawn?
The path by the Cao Stream is dangerous,
The Vulture Peak is high in the clouds:
Here the voice of the ancients was a mystery.
On a cliff ten thousand feet high
Five−leaved lotuses bloom
As scent coils round the shutters of the old palace.
At that time
Your knowledge smashes all the currents of thought;
The Dragon King and the Three Treasures can be seen.
This lyric poem is set to the tune Su Wu Man. Our story goes on to how our Buddha, the Tathagata, left the
Jade Emperor and went back to the Thunder Monastery, where he saw the three thousand Buddhas, five
hundred Arhats, eight great Vajrapanis and countless Bodhisattvas standing under the pairs of sala trees at the
foot of the Vulture Peak, all holding banners, canopies, jewels and magical flowers. The Tathagata brought his
propitious cloud to a halt and addressed them thus:
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 100
"With my deep insight
I surveyed the Three Worlds.
The origin of nature
Is ultimately emptiness,
Like the great void,
Containing nothing at all.
The subjection of this evil monkey
Was a mystery beyond understanding.
It is called the beginning of life and death:
Such is the appearance of things.
When he had spoken a sacred light filled the sky with forty−two rainbows that linked North and South
together. All who saw them bowed, and a moment later the Buddha gathered together some felicitous cloud
and climbed to the supreme Lotus Throne, where he seated himself in majesty.
Then the three thousand Buddhas, the five hundred Arhats, the eight Vajrapanis and the four Bodhisattvas
came forward to bow to him with their hands together and ask, "Who was it who wrecked the Heavenly
Palace and ruined the Peach Banquet?"
"The wretch was a monkey fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit," the Buddha replied, "whose
towering crimes would beggar description. None of the heavenly generals were able to subdue him, and when
Lord Lao Zi refined him with fire after Erlang had captured him, he was unharmed. When I went there he was
in the middle of the thunder generals, giving a great display of his martial prowess and his spirit. I stopped the
fighting and asked him what it was all about. He said that he had divine powers, was able to do
transformations, and could ride a somersault cloud for thirty−six thousand miles at a single jump. I made a
wager with him that he could not jump out of my hand, then grabbed him, turned my fingers into the Five
Elements Mountain, and sealed him under it. The Jade Emperor opened wide the golden gates of the Jade
Palace, and invited me to be the guest of honour at a Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven he gave to thank
me. After that I took my leave of him and came back here." They were all delighted by the news and they
congratulated him effusively, after which they withdrew group by group, each to go about his duties as all
rejoiced in the divine truth. Indeed:
Propitious vapours filled Paradise,
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 101
Rainbows surround the Venerable One.
The Western Paradise, known as the best,
Is ruled by the dharma King of non−phenomenon.
Black apes are always offering fruit,
Deer hold flowers in their mouths;
Blue phoenixes dance,
Coloured birds call;
Sacred turtles offer long life,
Immortal cranes present magic mushrooms.
Here they peacefully enjoy the Pure Land of the Jetavana Park,
The infinite realms of the Dragon Palace.
Every day flowers bloom,
Fruit is always ripe.
Through practicing silence they return to the truth,
Achieving reality by contemplation.
There is no birth nor death;
They neither wax nor wane.
Mists follow them as they come and go;
Untouched by heat or cold, they do not notice the years.
One day, as the Buddha dwelt in the Thunder Monastery on the Vulture Peak, he called together all the other
Buddhas, Arhats, guardian deities, Bodhisattvas, Vajrapanis, monks and nuns and said, "As we are beyond
time, I don't know how long it has been since the crafty ape was subdued and Heaven pacified, but by earthly
reckoning it must be about five hundred years. As today is a fine early autumn day and I have a precious bowl
filled with a hundred kinds of rare flowers and a thousand varieties of exotic fruit, what would you say to our
having an Ullambana Feast?" They all put their hands together and performed the reverence of going round
him three times in acceptance. The Buddha then ordered Ananda to hold the bowl of flowers and fruit while
Kasyapa laid them out. The hosts were moved to gratitude, which they expressed in verse.
The poem on happiness went:
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 102
The Star of Happiness shines bright before the Venerable One;
Gifts of happiness spread wide and deep, ever richer.
Fortune is boundless and lasts as long as the Earth;
A happy fate has the luck to be linked with Heaven.
Fields of happiness are widely sown and flourish every year;
The sea of happiness is mighty and deep, never changing.
Happiness fills Heaven and Earth, leaving legacies of happiness
Happiness grows beyond measure, eternally complete.
The poem on official rank went:
With rank as high as a mountain, coloured phoenixes call;
With rank ever increasing, we praise the evening star.
Salary raised to ten thousand bushels, and a healthy body;
Salary raised to a thousand tons, and the world at peace.
Rank and salary equaling Heaven, and eternal too;
Rank and fame as great as the sea, and even clearer.
Rank and favour continuing for ever, greatly to be admired;
Rank and nobility without bounds, like ten thousand kingdoms.
The poem on longevity went:
The Star of Longevity shines towards the Buddha;
The glories of the land of longevity start from here.
Fruits of longevity fill the bowls, glowing with good omen;
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 103
Longevity's flowers are newly plucked and placed on the lotus throne.
Poems of longevity, pure and elegant, full of rare conceits,
Songs of longevity sung with exquisite talent.
Life as long as sun and moon,
Life that will outlast both mountains and seas.
When the Bodhisattvas had presented all the poems they asked the Buddha to expound the fundamentals to
them. Then the Tathagata opened his excellent mouth and expounded the great Law and retribution. He spoke
about the wonderful scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the theory of the Five Aggregates as contained in the
Surangama−sutra; the deities and nagas gathered round, and flowers came raining down in profusion. Indeed:
The meditating heart shines like the moon in a thousand rivers;
The true nature embraces ten thousand miles of sky.
When the Buddha had finished his sermon he said to the host, "I have observed that the morality of the living
creatures of the four continents varies. In the Eastern Continent of Superior Body they worship Heaven and
Earth, their minds are livery and they are even−tempered. In the Northern Kuru Continent they are given to
killing living things, but they only do it to feed themselves; they are stupid and lazy by nature, but they do not
trample much on others. Our Western Continent of Cattle−gift has people who neither covet nor kill. They
nourish the vital essence and submerge the spirit; and although they produce no saints of the highest order,
they all live to a ripe old age. But in the Southern Jambu Continent they are greedy and lecherous and delight
in the sufferings of others; they go in for a great deal of killing and quarrelling. That continent can with truth
be called a vicious field of tongues and mouths, an evil sea of disputation. I now have Three Stores of True
Scriptures with which they can be persuaded to be good."
On hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas put their hands together in submission, then went forward to ask, "What
Three Stores of True Scriptures does the Tathagata have?"
"I have one store of the Vinaya, the law, which is about Heaven; one of Sastras, expositions which are
concerned with Earth; and one of Sutras, or scriptures, which save ghosts. The Three Stores consist of fifteen
thousand one hundred and forty−four scrolls in thirty−five classes. They are the scriptures for cultivating the
truth, and the gate to real goodness. I want to send them to the Eastern lands because it is intolerable that the
beings of that quarter should all be such stupid wretches who slander and defame the true word, do not
understand the gist of my Law, and have lapsed from the orthodox Yogacara Sect. How am I to find one with
the magic powers to go to the East, choose a worthy believer and bid him make the arduous crossing of a
thousand mountain and ten thousand rivers in search of the scriptures until he finally comes to this abode of
mine to receive them? When he does come they will be sent to the East for ever to convert all living beings,
which will be a blessing as big as a mountain, a cause for congratulation as deep as the sea. Is anyone willing
to go and find him?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 104
The Bodhisattva Guanyin went up to the lotus throne, and after going round the Buddha three times by way of
salutation she said, "Your untalented disciple wishes to go to the East to find a man to come and fetch the
scriptures." All present raised their heads to look at the Bodhisattva:
Her understanding filling out the four virtues,
Wisdom filling her golden body.
From her necklace hang pearls and jade,
Her bracelet is made of jewels.
Her hair is black clouds skillfully piled like coiling dragons;
Her embroidered girdle lightly sways, a phoenix wing.
Seagreen jade buttons,
A gown of white silk gauze,
Bathed with sacred light;
Brocade skirts,
A girdle of gold,
Shielded by propitious vapours.
Eyebrows like crescent moons,
Eyes like a pair of stars.
A jade face full of heavenly happiness,
Scarlet lips making a touch of red.
Her pure bottle of sweet dew is ever full,
The willow twigs in it are always green.
She delivers from the eight disasters,
Saves all living beings,
Great is her compassion.
She stays on Mount Tai,
Lives in the Southern Sea,
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 105
Rescues the suffering when she bears their cries,
Never failing to answer every call,
Infinitely divine and miraculous.
Her orchid heart admires the purple bamboo;
Her orchid nature loves the fragrant creeper.
She is the merciful ruler of Potaraka Island,
The living Guanyin of the Tide Cave.
The Buddha was very pleased to see her.
"No one but the venerable Guanyin, whose divine powers are so great, will do for this mission," he said.
"What instructions have you for your disciple as she goes to the East?" Guanyin asked.
"You must watch the route all the way," said the Buddha. "You may not go via the Milky Way, but if
necessary you may have a little cloud or mist. As you cross mountains and rivers you must note the distances
carefully to enable you to give full instructions to the man who will come to fetch the scriptures. But that true
believer will, I'm afraid, have a difficult journey, so I shall give you five treasures for him." The Buddha
ordered Ananda and Kasyapa to bring out a brocade cassock and a nine−ringed monk's staff.
"Give this cassock and staff to him who will come to fetch the scriptures: they are for him to use. If he is
determined to come here, he can avoid the Wheel of Reincarnation by wearing this cassock, and he will be
free from evil if he carries this staff." The Bodhisattva bowed and took them. The Buddha then produced three
bands.
"These precious things are called 'tight bands,'" he told the Bodhisattva as he handed them to her. "Although
all three of them look the same, they have different uses. I also have three Band−Tightening Spells. If you
meet any devils with great magic powers on your journey you should persuade them to reform and become the
disciples of the pilgrim who will come to fetch the scriptures. If they do not do is they are told these bands
should be put on their heads, where they will of themselves take root in the flesh. If the appropriate spell for
each one is recited the victim's eyes will bulge, his head will ache, and his forehead will split open. He will
thus be certainly induced to adopt our religion."
When he finished speaking the Bodhisattva bowed eagerly and withdrew. She told Huian the Novice to
accompany her, and he took his iron staff weighing a thousand pounds with him so that he could as a
demon−quelling strongman for the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva wrapped the cassock up in a bundle and
gave it to him to carry. She then put the golden bands away safely and went down the Vulture Peak with the
staff in her hand. This journey was to have consequences:
The Buddha's disciple comes back to his original vow;
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 106
The Venerable Golden Cicada is dressed in sandalwood.
When the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain the Gold−headed Immortal of the Jade Truth Temple
stopped her at the temple gate and invited her to take some tea. But she dared not stop for long, and so she
said, "I have been given a sacred command by the Tathagata to go to the East and find a man who will come
to fetch the scriptures."
"When will he arrive?" the Immortal asked.
"It is not definite," the Bodhisattva replied, "but he will probably reach here in two or three years' time." She
took her leave of the Immortal and as she traveled amid cloud and mist she estimated the distances. There are
some verses to prove it:
She cared nothing of the journey of ten thousand miles to find him,
But worried about finding the right man.
Looking for the man seemed to be very chancy,
But how can it be a mere coincidence?
One who teaches the Way for the wrong motives will distort it;
He who explains it without faith will preach in vain.
Whoever will try and know it with his whole being,
Is bound to have a future ahead of him.
As the teacher and her disciple were on their journey they suddenly noticed a thousand miles of weak water,
which was the River of Flowing Sands.
"Disciple," said the Bodhisattva, "this will be hard to cross for the man who will come to fetch the scriptures,
as he will be of impure bone and mortal flesh. How will he do it?"
"Teacher, how wide does the river look to you?" asked Huian. The Bodhisattva stopped her cloud to
investigate. She saw:
Joining up with the deserts to the East,
Reaching the foreign kingdoms in the West,
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 107
Wuge in the South
The Tatars in the North.
It was about three hundred miles across,
And three million miles long.
As the waters flowed it was like the earth turning over,
The waves were like rearing mountains.
Broad and boundless,
Vast and mighty:
From three miles' distance the mighty flood is heard.
Immortals' rafts do not reach here,
Lotus leaves cannot float on it.
The sun slants through withered plants and bathes the crooked shore;
Brown clouds block its light and darken the long bank.
How could merchants pass this way?
Has a fisherman ever moored here?
No geese alight on the sandbanks,
But apes cry on the distant shore.
Its color comes from bountiful red smartweed,
While delicate white duckweed drifts together.
As the Bodhisattva was surveying the scene she heard a splash and saw a hideous ogre leap out of the waves.
He was
Not really blue,
Not really black,
With an evil face;
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 108
Neither tall,
Nor short,
Bare legs and a muscular body.
His eyes flashed
Like a pair of tortoise−shell lanterns;
The comers of his mouth were as sinister
As a butcher's cauldron.
Protruding fangs like swords,
Red hair, matted and unkempt.
He roared like a clap of thunder,
And ran across the waves with the speed of wind.
This ogre climbed up the bank with a pole in his hands to catch the Bodhisattva, but was stopped by Huian's
staff.
"Don't run away," Huian shouted as the ogre advanced towards him. The battle that ensued between them was
quite terrifying:
Moksa with his iron club,
Using his divine powers to protect the Bodhisattva;
The ogre with his demon−quelling pole
Displaying his valour for all be was worth.
A pair of silver dragons dancing by the river;
Two holy monks in battle on the bank.
The one used his skill to control the River of Flowing Sands
The other had distinguished himself in protecting Guanyin.
The one could make the waves leap and roll,
The other could breathe out fogs and gales.
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 109
When the waves leapt and rolled, Heaven and Earth were darkened;
In the fogs and gales, sun and moon were dimmed.
The demon−quelling pole
Was like a white tiger coming down from the mountain;
The iron club
Was like a crouching yellow dragon.
When one goes into action
It beats the undergrowth to start the snakes;
When the other lashes out,
It parts the pines to flush the sparrowhawks.
They fight till the sky goes dark
And the stars twinkle.
Then the mist rises,
And earth and sky are dim.
The one has long been unrivalled in the Weak Waters;
The other has always been the hero of Vulture Peak.
When the pair of them had fought several dozen rounds inconclusively the ogre blocked his opponent's iron
staff and asked, "Where are you from, monk, that you dare to take me on?"
"I am Prince Moksa, the second son of the Pagoda−bearing Heavenly King Li," the other replied. "I am also
Huian the Novice. I am now protecting my teacher on her journey to the East to find the man who will fetch
the scriptures. Which monster are you? How dare you stand in our way?" The ogre then realized who he was.
"I remember," he said, "you used to cultivate your conduct with Guanyin of the Southern Sea in the Purple
Bamboo Grove. Why have you come here?"
"Can't you see my teacher standing there on the bank?"
When the ogre heard this he chanted "na−a−aw" several times to show his respect, withdrew his pole and let
Moksa seize it. Then he bowed to Guanyin and said, "Forgive me, Bodhisattva, and listen to what I have to
tell you. I am not a demon, but the Curtain Raising General who used to stand in attendance by the imperial
chariot in the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Just because I accidentally smashed a crystal dish at a Peach Banquet
the Jade Emperor had me given eight hundred strokes of the rod, exiled me to the lower world, and made me
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 110
look like this. And on top of it all every seven days he sends a flying sword here to stab my chest over a
hundred times before it goes back again. It's agony. I get so unbearably cold and hungry that I have to emerge
from the waves every two or three days to devour a traveler. I never thought that in my ignorance I would
insult the merciful Bodhisattva today."
"You were exiled here for a crime against Heaven, but now you are deepening your guilt by harming living
beings. I am now going to the East on the Buddha's orders to find the man who will fetch the scriptures. Why
don't you become one of us and ensure yourself good retribution in future by accompanying the pilgrim as a
disciple and ascending to the Western Heaven to pay homage to the Buddha and seek the scriptures? I will see
to it that the flying sword stops coming to pierce you, and when you are successful you will be forgiven your
crimes and your old job will be given back to you. What do you think of that?"
"I am willing to return to the truth," the ogre replied, then went closer as he continued, "Bodhisattva, I have
lost count of the number of people I have eaten here, and I have even devoured some pilgrims who were
trying to fetch scriptures. I throw the heads of all my victims into the river, and they all sink to the bottom as
not even goose−down will float on this water. But the skeletons of those nine pilgrims floated and would not
sink. I was so impressed by this that I threaded them together with rope and play with them in my spare time.
But I am afraid that the man who is to fetch the scriptures may not get this far, which would wreck my
future."
"Of course he'll get here," the Bodhisattva replied. "You should hang those skeletons from your head and wait
for him. They will come in useful."
"In that case," the ogre said, "I shall await your instructions." The Bodhisattva then laid her hands on his head
and administered the monastic rules to him, chose for him the surname Sha ("Sand") and gave him the
Buddhist name of Wujing ("Awakened to Purity"). Then he entered monkish life and took the Bodhisattva
across the river. He washed his heart, cleansed his thoughts, and stopped killing living creatures. All he did
now was to wait for the pilgrim who would come to fetch the scriptures.
After leaving him the Bodhisattva and Huian hurried on towards the East. When they had been travelling for a
long time they saw a high mountain veiled with an evil mist, and they were unable to climb it on foot. Just
when they were intending to cross the mountain by cloud, a gale wind blew up and a monster suddenly
appeared. He too was very menacing to behold:
His entrails hung from his mouth, rolled up and knotted;
His ears were like rush fans, his eyes shone gold.
His teeth were sharp as steel files,
And when he opened his mouth it was like a brazier.
His golden helmet was tied firmly round his cheeks;
His armour, bound with a silken sash, was a python's sloughed−off skin.
In his hands he held a nailed rake like a dragon's claw,
At his waist hung a curved bow the shape of a half−moon.
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 111
His martial might overawed the Year Planet;
His overweening spirit threatened the heavenly gods.
He rushed upon them, and without a second thought smote at the Bodhisattva with his rake. Moksa the Novice
parried his blow, and shouted at the top of his voice, "Remember your manners, damned monster, and watch
out for my staff."
"Monk," the other replied, "you don't know how to keep yourself in one piece. Mind my rake!" At the foot of
the mountain the pair of them rushed upon each other as they struggled for supremacy. It was a fine battle:
The fierce and murderous ogre;
Huian, imposing and able.
The iron staff could pulverize the heart;
The rake struck at the face.
The dust thrown up darkened Heaven and Earth;
The flying sand and stones startled gods and ghouls.
The nine−toothed rake
Gleamed and flashed
As its pair of rings resounded;
The lone staff
Was ominously black
As it whirled in its owner's hands.
One was the heir of a Heavenly King,
One defended the Law on Potaraka Island.
The other was an evil fiend in a mountain cave.
In their battle for mastery,
None knew who the winner would be.
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 112
Just when the fight was getting really good, Guanyin threw down a lotus flower from mid−air to separate the
two weapons. The monster, shocked at the sight of it, asked, "Where are you from, monk? How dare you try
to fool me with a 'flower in front of the eyes?'"
"I'll get you, you stinking, flesh−eyed mortal," replied Moksa. "I am a disciple of the Bodhisattva of the
Southern Sea, and this lotus was thrown down by her. Don't you know that?"
"By the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea do you mean Guanyin Who Eliminates the Three Calamities and
Saves from the Eight Disasters?" the monster asked.
"Who else could I mean?" retorted Moksa. The monster threw down his rake, bowed to him, and asked,
"Where is the Bodhisattva, elder brother? May I trouble you to introduce me?" Moksa looked up and pointed.
"There she is," he said. The monster kowtowed to her and shouted in a shrill voice, "Forgive me, Bodhisattva,
forgive me." Guanyin brought her cloud down to earth, went over to him and asked, "Are you a wild boar
become a devil or a pig turned monster? How dare you block my way?"
"I'm neither a wild boar nor a pig," the monster replied. "I used to be Marshal Tian Peng in the Milky Way.
Because I took some wine to seduce the moon maiden, the Jade Emperor sentenced me to two thousand
hammer blows and exile in the mortal world. My spirit had to find a womb to occupy, but I lost my way and
entered the womb of a sow. That's why I look like this. I ate up my sow mother, drove all the other pigs away,
and seized this mountain, where I keep myself by eating people. I never meant to offend you, Bodhisattva.
Save me, save me, I beg you."
"What is this mountain called?" the Bodhisattva asked.
"It's called the Mount of Blessing, and the cave in it is called the Cloud Pathway Cave. Second Sister Luan,
who used to live there, saw that I knew how to fight and asked me to be the head of her household as her
husband, but she died within a year and all her property became mine. As the days lengthened into years I
found that I had no way of supporting myself, so I had to eat people to keep myself going as I had done
before. Forgive me my sins, I beg of you, Bodhisattva."
"There is an old saying," the Bodhisattva replied, "that goes, 'If you want to have a future, don't do anything
with no future in it?' You broke the law in the upper world, and since then your vicious nature has not been
reformed. You have further sinned by taking life, so this surely means that you will be doubly punished."
"Future!" said the monster angrily. "According to you I should have lived on air! As the saying goes, 'By the
government's law you're beaten to death, and by the Buddha's law you starve to death.' Clear off! Clear off! If
you don't I'll capture this pilgrim and eat this plump and tender old woman. I don't give a hoot if it's double
sinning, triple sinning, or sinning a thousand or ten thousand times over."
"'If a man wishes to be good, Heaven will certainly allow him to be,'" said the Bodhisattva. "If you are
prepared to submit to the truth, there are of course, ways to feed yourself. There are the five kinds of
food−grains, and they are sufficient to assuage hunger, so why eat people to keep alive?"
When the monster heard these words it was as if he awoke from a dream, and he said to the Bodhisattva, "I
would love to reform, but isn't it true that 'a sinner against Heaven has nowhere to pray to?'"
"I'm going to the East on the orders of the Buddha to find the man who will fetch the scriptures," she replied.
"You can be a disciple of his and make this journey to the Western Heaven; thus you will gain merit and atone
for your crimes, and I will see to it that you are freed from disaster."
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 113
"I'll go with him, I'll go with him," the monster said over and over again. The Bodhisattva then laid her hands
on his head and he accepted the monastic rules. She gave him the surname Zhu ("Pig") because of his
appearance, and gave him the Buddhist name Zhu Wuneng ("Pig Awakened to Power"). She ordered him to
adhere to the truth and eat only vegetarian food, cutting out the five pungent vegetables as well as the three
forbidden things; wild goose, dog and fish. He was now to wait single−mindedly for the pilgrim who would
come to fetch the scriptures.
The Bodhisattva and Moksa then took their leave of the Pig Awakened to Power and continued on their way
by low−altitude cloud. As they were travelling along they heard a jade dragon call to them in mid−air.
"Which dragon are you?" the Bodhisattva asked as she went up to him. "And why are you undergoing
punishment here?"
"I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I burnt up the bright pearls in the
palace, my father reported me to the court of Heaven as a rebel. The Jade Emperor had me hung up in mid−air
and given three hundred strokes, and I am to be executed any day now. I beg you to save me, Bodhisattva."
When she heard his plea the Bodhisattva went in through the Southern Gates of Heaven with Moksa. Here
they were met by the Heavenly Teachers Qiu and Zhang, who asked them, "Where are you going?"
"I would like an audience with the Jade Emperor." The two Heavenly Teachers hurried in to announce her,
and the Jade Emperor came out of his palace to receive her. The Bodhisattva went forward to greet him and
said, "On my way to the East on the orders of the Buddha to find the man to fetch the scriptures, I met a
wicked dragon suspended in mid−air.. I have come here especially to ask you to spare his life and give him to
me so that I can teach him to serve the pilgrim with his legs." On hearing this the Jade Emperor issued a
decree pardoning him, and he sent a heavenly general to release him and give him to the Bodhisattva. The
Bodhisattva thanked him for his generosity and left. The young dragon kowtowed to show how grateful he
was for having his life spared, and he obediently did what the Bodhisattva told him to. She took him to a deep
ravine, where he was to wait until the pilgrim came. When that happened he was to turn into a white horse and
achieve merit by going to the Western Heaven. On receiving his orders the young dragon hid himself.
The Bodhisattva led Moksa the Novice across this mountain, and they hurried on towards the East. Before
they had gone much further they suddenly saw ten thousand beams of golden light and a thousand wisps of
propitious vapour.
"Teacher," said Moksa, "the place where all the light is coming from is the Five Elements Mountain, where
the Tathagata's restriction order is posted."
"This must be cause that Great Sage Equaling Heaven who wrecked the Peach Banquet and threw the
Heavenly Palace into chaos is imprisoned there."
"That's right," Moksa replied, and teacher and pupil climbed the mountain together to look at the paper. On it
were written the true words Om mani padme bum, and when the Bodhisattva saw them she sighed deeply and
composed a poem that went:
"Pity the evil monkey who did not obey the lord
In his arrogance he showed off his valour in the old days,
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 114
In his folly he wrecked the Peach Banquet,
And he had the effrontery to sin in the Tushita Palace.
In the army of a hundred thousand there was none to match him;
His might was felt above the ninefold heavens.
But now he has been caught by our Tathagata, the Buddha:
Will he ever be able to unleash his talents and win more glory?"
The conversation between teacher and disciple had disturbed the Great Sage, who shouted from under the
roots of the mountain, "Who's that up there?" When she heard this the Bodhisattva hurried down the mountain
to visit him. At the foot of the mountainside the local gods, the mountain gods and the heavenly generals who
were guarding the Great Sage all bowed to the Bodhisattva in greeting and took her to the Great Sage. She
saw that he was pressed down inside a stone box, so that he could speak but could not move his body.
"Monkey," the Bodhisattva said, "do you know who I am?" The Great Sage opened wide his fiery eyes with
their golden pupils, nodded his head and shouted at the top of his voice, "Of course I recognize you. You,
thank goodness, are the All−Compassionate. All−Merciful Deliverer from Suffering, the Bodhisattva Guanyin
from Potaraka Island in the Southern Sea. You're a very welcome visitor. Every day here seems like a year,
and nobody I know has ever come to see me. Where have you come from?"
"I have received a mandate from the Buddha to go to the East and find the man who will fetch the scriptures,"
she replied, "and as I was passing this way I decided to come over and see you."
"The Buddha fooled me and crushed me under this mountain−−I haven't been able to stretch myself for five
hundred years. I desperately hope that you will be obliging enough to rescue me, Bodhisattva."
"You wretch," she replied, "you have such an appalling criminal record that I'm afraid you'd only make more
trouble if I got you out."
"I have already repented," he said, "and hope that you will show me the road I should follow. I want to
cultivate my conduct." Indeed:
When an idea is born in a man's mind
It is known throughout Heaven and Earth.
If good and evil are not rewarded and punished
The world is bound to go to the bad.
Journey to the West
Chapter 8 115
The Bodhisattva was delighted to hear what he had to say.
"The sacred scriptures say," she replied, '"If one's words are good, they will meet with a response from even a
thousand miles away; if they are bad, they will be opposed from the same distance.' If this is your state of
mind, then wait while I go to the East to find the man who will fetch the scriptures; I'll tell him to rescue you.
You can be his disciple, observe and uphold the faith, enter our Buddha's religion, and cultivate good
retribution for yourself in the future. What do you say to that?"
"I'll go, I'll go," the Great Sage repeated over and over again.
"As you have reformed," she said, "I'll give you a Buddhist name."
"I've already got a name. It's Sun Wukong." The Bodhisattva, very pleased, said, "I made two converts earlier,
and their names both contained Wu ('Awakened'). There's no need to give you any further instructions, so I'll
be off." The Great Sage, now aware of his own Buddha−nature, was converted to the Buddha's religion; and
the Bodhisattva devotedly continued her search for a saintly monk.
After leaving that place she and Huian carried straight on to the East, and before long they reached Chang'an,
the capital of the Great Tang. Putting away their mists and clouds, teacher and pupil turned themselves into a
pair of scabby itinerant monks and went inside the city of Chang'an. It was already dark, and beside the great
market street they saw a shrine to a local tutelary god and went in. The local god was thrown into confusion at
the sight of them, and the devil soldiers quaked with terror; they knew that she was a Bodhisattva, and
kowtowed to her in greeting. The local god then scurried off to tell the City God, the Lord of the Alter, and
the gods of all the other shrines in Chang'an. When they knew that the Bodhisattva had come they all went to
report to her and said, "Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our crime in being late to welcome you."
"You mustn't let a whisper of this get out," she said. "I have come here on a decree from the Buddha to find
someone to fetch the scriptures. I shall be borrowing your temple for a few days while I find this true monk,
and then I shall go back." All the gods returned to their own shrines, and they took the local god to stay in the
temple of the City God. Teacher and disciple disguised their true appearances. If you don't know whom they
found to fetch the scriptures, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 9
Chen Guangrui Comes to Grief on His Way to His Post
The Monk of the River Current Avenges His Parents
The story goes on to tell that Chang'an city in the great land of Shaanxi had been a place where emperors and
kings had made their capitals for generation after generation. Ever since the Zhou, Qin and Han dynasties, the
Three Prefectures had been as rich as brocade, and the eight rivers had flowed round its walls. It was indeed a
famous country. At that time Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang was on the throne. He had changed the
name of the reign−period to Zhenguan, and had been reigning for thirteen years. The year was ji si and the
world was at peace; tribute was being sent in from the eight directions, and all within the four seas
acknowledged themselves as subjects.
One day Taizong took his seat on the throne and assembled all his military and civilian officials. When they
had finished making their greetings, the minister Wei Zheng came forward from the ranks of officials and
memorialized, "As the world is now at peace and the eight directions are calm, an examination should be held
in accordance with the practice of the ancients. Thus we could recruit wise scholars and select men of talent to

help with our civilizing mission."
"The suggestion of our wise minister is right," said the Emperor, and notices inviting worthy men to compete
in the examinations were posted throughout the empire. All the Confucian scholars on the civil or military
rolls in every prefecture, district and county who had distinguished themselves in the three−stage
examinations for their understanding of literature were to go to Chang'an for a final test.
When this notice reached the district of Haizhou it was seen by a man called Chen E, whose courtesy name
was Guangrui. He returned home and said to Madame Zhang, his mother, "The court has issued a yellow
notice saying that the Chancellery will be opened for an examination to select men of wisdom and talent.
Your child wants to go and take part. If I am given an official post it will bring me fame and make our family
illustrious; my wife will be given a title, my sons will be given preferential treatment; and it will bring glory
to our house. Such is my ambition; and I have come to tell you, mother, that I am going."
"You are a scholar, my son," his mother replied, "and it is right that 'one who studies when young should
travel when grown up'. But do take care on the journey to the examinations, and if you are given office, come
back home as soon as you can." Chen Guangrui then ordered his servants to get his luggage together, took his
leave of his mother, and started off on his journey. When he reached Chang'an the examination grounds were
open and he went in. Having been successful in this examination, he went to the palace for the three questions
test. The Tang Emperor personally awarded him the first place, and he was paraded round the streets on
horseback for three days.
It happened that just when the procession was passing the gateway of the minister Yin Kaishan, the minister's
unmarried daughter Wenqiao, whose other name was Man−tang−qiao (Beauty Throughout the Hall), was
making decorations for the house and throwing an embroidered ball to see who her future husband would be.
When Chen Guangrui passed below she saw at once that he was exceptionally handsome, and she knew that
he had come first in the recent examinations. She was thoroughly taken with him, and when she dropped her
embroidered ball it landed squarely on his black hat. To the sound of pipes and flutes a dozen or so
maidservants and serving women hurried downstairs to take hold of the head of Chen Guangrui's horse and
invite him into the minister's mansion to marry his daughter. The minister and his wife came into the main
hall, and when they had called for a master of ceremonies they married their daughter to Guangrui. When
bride and groom had bowed to Heaven, Earth and each other they both bowed to the bride's father and mother.
The minister ordered a banquet, and there was a night of drinking and celebration. The bride and groom went
hand in hand into the bridal chamber.
At the third quarter of the fifth watch the next morning Emperor Taizong took his throne in the Golden
Chariot Hall, and the civil and military officials came to court.
"What office should Chen Guangrui who came top in the examinations be given?" the Emperor asked, and the
minister Wei Zheng replied, "Your subject has gone through the list of the prefectures and commanderies, and
found that the district of Jiangzhou needs a prefect. I beg Your Majesty to give him this office." The Emperor
therefore appointed him prefect of Jiangzhou and ordered him to pack his belongings and set off as he had to
be there by a set date. Chen Guangrui thanked the Emperor for his grace and withdrew. He went back to the
minister's mansion and consulted his wife, then he took his leave of his parents−in−law and set off together
with her for his post in Jiangzhou.
It was late spring as they left Chang'an at the start of their journey. Warm breezes were coaxing the willows
into green, and light rain was touching the blossoms with red. Chen Guangrui was able to call at his own
home on the way, so he and his bride could pay their respects to his mother, Madame Zhang.
"Congratulations, my son," she said. "And you have brought a bride back with you too."
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 117
"Thanks to my mother's blessings, your son was placed first in the examinations," he replied, "and given a
parade through the streets on His Majesty's orders. As I was passing the gateway of minister Yin's residence, I
happened to be hit by an embroidered ball, and the minister was kind enough to give me his daughter's hand.
The court has appointed me prefect of Jiangzhou, so I have come to fetch you, mother, and take you with me
to my post." Madame Zhang was overjoyed, and she packed her luggage and traveled with them.
One night, after they had been on the road for several days, they put up at the Liu the Second's Ten Thousand
Flowers Inn, where Madame Zhang was suddenly taken ill.
"As I'm not feeling well," she said to her son, "I'd better stay in this inn for a couple of days to get over it
before going on." Chen Guangrui accepted her suggestion. The next morning he saw a man selling a
golden−coloured carp in front of the inn and brought it from him for a string of copper coins, intending to
have it lightly fried for his mother. Then he noticed it blinking.
"It's said that if a fish or a snake blinks it is no ordinary creature," he thought. He asked the fisherman where
he had caught it.
"In the Hongjiang River, five miles from the prefectural capital," the fisherman replied. Chen Guangrui had
the fish taken back to the Hongjiang River to be released there, then went back to the inn to tell his mother
about what had happened.
"It is good to release living things," his mother said, "and I am very pleased." Then Chen Guangrui said, "We
have been at this inn for three days, and the time limit set for me is a tight one, so I must be on my way
tomorrow morning. Are you well enough yet, mother?"
"I'm still poorly," his mother replied, "and it's so hot to travel now that I'm afraid it might make me seriously
ill. You had better take a couple of rooms for me and leave me some money; I'll stay here for the time being.
You two can go on ahead to your post. Come back to fetch me in the autumn when it's cooler." Having
discussed it with his wife he rented a wing for her and gave her some money, then they took their leave of her
and set off.
It was a hard journey, setting off every day at dawn and not stopping till nightfall, and before they realized it
they reached the ford over the Hongjiang Estuary. They saw two boatmen, Liu Hong and Li Biao, punt their
ferry to the bank for them. This was the disaster, these were the enemies, that Chen Guangrui had been fated
to meet ever since before he was born. He told his servant to put the luggage on board, while he and his wife
climbed sedately into the boat. Liu Hong stared at Miss Yin, and saw that her face was like a full moon, her
eyes like autumn waves, her tiny mouth like a cherry, and her waist as supple as a willow; her charms would
have made fishes sink and wild geese fall from the sky, and her beauty put moon and flowers to shame. Evil
thoughts surged up in him, and he conspired with Li Biao to punt the boat to a misty and deserted place and
wait till the middle of the night, when they killed first the servant and then Chen Guangrui. They pushed both
the corpses into the river and went away.
When the young lady saw her husband killed she tried to fling herself into the water, but Liu Hong put his
arms round her and said, "If you come with me, you'll be all right; but if you don't, I'll cut you in half." Unable
to think of any other way out, the young lady had to agree to stay with Liu Hong for the time being at least.
The murderer took the boat across to the Southern bank and gave it to Li Biao. Then he dressed up in Chen
Guangrui's clothes and, armed with the dead man's credentials, went with the young lady to take up his post in
Jiangzhou.
The corpse of the murdered servant floated with the current, but Chen Guangrui's body sank straight to the
bottom and did not move. A patrolling yaksha demon stationed at the Hongjiang Estuary saw him and rushed
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 118
straight back to the dragon palace to report. He arrived just as the dragon king was entering the throne−hall.
"Someone has murdered a learned gentleman at the Hongjiang Estuary, and thrown the body into the bed of
the river," he reported. The dragon king had the body brought in and laid in front of him. After examining it
carefully he said, "This is the benefactor who saved my life: why has he been murdered? As the saying goes,
'Always repay a kindness'. I must save his life today to repay him for the favour he did me in the past." He
wrote a memorandum and sent a yaksha with it to the city god and local god of Hongzhou asking for the
scholar's soul so that he could save his life. The city god and the local god told a junior devil to give Chen
Guangrui's soul to the yaksha, who took it back to the palace of crystal and reported to the dragon king.
"What is your name, scholar?" asked the dragon king. "Where are you from? What brought you here, and why
were you killed?"
Chen Guangrui bowed to him and replied, "My name is Chen E and my courtesy name is Guangrui. I come
from Hongnong County in Haizhou Prefecture. I was given first place in the recent examinations, and was on
my way with my wife to take up my post as prefect of Jiangzhou when we boarded a ferry at the bank of this
river. The boatman Liu Hong lusted after my wife, so he killed me and threw me overboard. I beg you to save
me, Your Majesty."
"So that's how things stand," said the dragon king. "I am the golden carp you released. You saved me then, so
I must help you now that you are in trouble." He had Guangrui's body placed beside a wall and put a "Face
Preserving Pearl" in its mouth to stop it from decomposing so that the soul could be returned to it in future for
him to obtain his revenge. "As you are now a true soul, you shall stay in my palace for the time being as a
commander," the dragon king added. Chen Guangrui kowtowed in thanks, and the dragon king gave a banquet
to welcome him.
Miss Yin's hatred for the villainous Liu Hong was such that she wished she could eat his flesh and spread his
flayed hide on her bed, but as she was pregnant and the child had not yet been born she had to force herself to
go with him. In the twinkling of an eye they reached Jiangzhou. The clerks and constables all turned out to
welcome him, and the subordinate officials in the prefecture gave a banquet for him in the main hall of his
office.
"Now that I, your student, have come here, I shall be entirely dependent on the support of all you gentlemen,"
said Liu Hong.
"Your honour is a great genius," the officials replied, "and you will naturally treat the people as your own
children, thus cutting down litigation and making punishment unnecessary. We will all be able to rely on
you−−your excessive modesty is uncalled for." When the banquet was over they all went away.
Time flew by. One day, when Liu Hong was far away on official business, the young lady was in a
summerhouse in the official residence sighing sadly as she thought of her mother−in−law and her husband.
Suddenly she felt weak and her belly started to ache. She fell to the ground unconscious, and before she knew
it she gave birth to a son. She heard a voice in her ear saying, "Man−tang−qiao, you must do as I tell you. I am
the Lord of the Southern Pole Star, and I have come to give you this son on the orders of the Bodhisattva
Guanyin. One day he will be extraordinarily famous. When the villainous Liu comes back he will certainly
want to kill this boy, so you must look after him with great care. Your husband has been rescued by the
dragon king; one day you will be reunited with him and your son, and your sufferings will be at an end.
Remember my words. Wake up, wake up!"
When the young lady came to she remembered every word he had spoken, but as she wrapped the baby tight
in swaddling clothes, she could not think what to do. When Liu Hong came back he wanted to drown the child
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 119
the moment he saw him, but the young lady said, "It's already dark: we can throw him in the river tomorrow."
Fortunately Liu Hong had to go a long way away on urgent business the next day.
"If I wait till that villain returns my son will be killed," thought the young lady, "so the best thing would be to
abandon him in the river as soon as possible and let fate determine whether he is to live or do die. If Heaven is
merciful someone will rescue the boy and bring him up, and we shall be reunited one day." Then, worrying
that she might not be able to recognize him, she bit open her finger and wrote a letter in blood giving a full
account of his parentage and background. Then she bit off the little toe of the child's left foot to be an
identifying mark, wrapped him up in one of her own shifts, and carried him out of the official residence when
nobody was looking. Luckily the residence was not far from the river bank. When she reached it she wept for
a while and was just going to throw him in when she noticed a board floating beside the bank. The young lady
bowed to Heaven in her gratitude and tied the child to the board with her sash, placing the blood letter next to
his chest. Then she pushed him out into the stream to go where he would and returned to the yamen in tears.
The boy floated downstream on the plank until he came to a stop under the Jinshan Temple. The abbot of this
temple was a monk called Faming who by cultivating the Truth and being awakened to the Way had found the
secret of avoiding rebirth. As he was sitting at his meditation he heard a baby crying, and he hurried anxiously
down to the riverside to look. He saw a baby lying on a board beside the bank, and got him out of the water as
quickly as he could. When he read the letter written in blood that was on the baby's chest he knew why he was
there. He gave the child the milk−name Jiangliu, "River Current," and arranged for him to be fostered. The
letter in blood he put away in a very safe place. Time passed like an arrow, and the days and months moved as
fast as a shuttle. When Jiangliu reached the age of seventeen the abbot told him to have his head tonsured and
enter the religious life. Giving him the Buddhist name Xuanzang he laid his hands upon his head and
instructed him to observe the monastic discipline. Xuanzang was determined to cultivate the Way.
One day in late spring the whole community gathered under the shade of some pine trees to expound the
scriptures, meditate and discuss the inner mysteries. A bibulous, meat−eating monk who had been confounded
in a disputation by Xuanzang lost his temper and started to abuse him: "You animal, you don't know your own
surname or who your parents were. Don't try any of your clever tricks here." Stung by this abuse, Xuanzang
went into the temple and knelt before his teacher with tears streaming from his eyes.
"All men who are born between Heaven and Earth, and who are endowed with the Positive, the Negative, and
the Five Elements−−all are begotten by a father and reared by a mother," he said. "How can there be any man
alive who never had father and mother?" He begged over and over again to know his parents' names.
"If you really wish to find out about your father and mother, come with me into my cell," said the abbot, and
they went there together. The abbot lifted down a little box from on top of a massive beam, opened it, took out
a letter written in blood and a shift, and gave them to Xuanzang, who unfolded the letter and read it. At last he
learned about his parents and the wrongs they had suffered.
When he had read it he collapsed, weeping and crying out, "How can I be a man if I don't avenge my father
and mother? For seventeen years I haven't known my own parents, but now I know that I have a mother. I
would not be alive today, teacher, had you not rescued me and brought me up. Please allow me to go and see
my mother, then I will put an incense−burner on my head and rebuild the temple to repay the great kindness
you have shown me."
"If you want to go and look for your mother you had better take the letter written in blood and the shift with
you. If you go to the private residence of the prefect of Jiangzhou you will be able to see your mother."
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 120
Xuanzang did as his teacher had said and went to Jiangzhou as a mendicant monk. It happened that Liu Hong
was away on business, and as Heaven had arranged for mother and son to meet, Xuanzang went straight to the
gateway of the residence to beg for alms. Miss Yin had dreamt the previous night of the moon being eclipsed
and then coming back to its full roundness.
"I have never heard from my mother−in−law," she thought, "and my husband was murdered by that evil man.
My son was abandoned on the river, and if he was rescued and brought up, he would be seventeen now. Who
knows, perhaps Heaven is going to make us meet today." As she was deep in her reflections she heard
someone chanting scriptures and calling for alms in front of her home, so she thought she would go out and
ask him where he had come from, and he replied, "I am a disciple of Abbot Faming of the Jinshan Temple."
"A disciple of Abbot Faming of the Jinshan Temple, are you?" she said. She asked him in and gave him a
vegetarian meal while observing closely the way he moved and talked.
He seemed very much like her husband, so she sent the servants away and asked, "Tell me, young teacher,
have you been a monk since childhood or did you become one later in life? What is your name? Do you have
a mother and father?"
"I did not become a monk when I was a child nor when I was older," he replied. "I must tell you that I bear a
hatred as deep as the sea because of a terrible wrong. My father was murdered and my mother carried off by
an evil man. The Abbot Faming, my teacher, told me to come and find my mother in the residence of the
prefect of Jiangzhou."
"What is your mother's name?" she asked.
"My mother's name is Yin Wenqiao," he replied. "My father was called Chen Guangrui. My milk−name was
Jiangliu, and my Buddhist name is Xuanzang."
"I am Yin Wenqiao," she said, then added, "Have you any proof?" When he learned that she was his mother,
Xuanzang fell to his knees and wept aloud.
"Mother," he said, "if you don't believe me, then look at this evidence−−the blood letter and the shift." As
soon as she saw that they were the real ones, she and her son embraced each other and wept.
Then she said, "Go away at once."
"I can't possibly leave you, mother, on the very day I've seen you after seventeen years of not even knowing
who my parents were," he said.
"My child, you must go away as fast as you can," she replied. "The evil Liu will certainly kill you if he comes
back. Tomorrow I'll pretend to be ill and say that I once made a vow to donate a hundred pairs of monks'
shoes. I'll come to your temple to fulfil the vow, and I'll talk to you then." Xuanzang obediently bowed to her
and left.
Now that she had seen her son Miss Yin was both anxious and happy. One day she said that she was ill, and
she lay in her bed refusing food and tea. When Liu Hong came back and asked what was the matter she said,
"When I was young I once vowed that I would donate a hundred pairs of monks' shoes. Five days ago I
dreamt that a monk came with a sharp sword in his hand to demand the shoes, and since then I haven't been
feeling well."
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 121
"That's easily done," said Liu Hong. "Why didn't you mention it before?" He took his place in the official hall
and gave instructions to yamen assistants Wang and Li that every household living in the city of Jiangzhou
was to make a pair of monk's shoes and hand them in within five days.
When the common people had handed all the shoes in, Miss Yin said to Liu Hong, "Now that the shoes have
been made, what temples are there here to which I can take them to fulfil my vow?"
"In Jiangzhou we have the Jinshan Temple and the Jiaoshan Temple; you can go to whichever of them you
prefer," replied Liu Hong.
"I've long heard that the Jinshan Temple is a good one, so I'll go there," she said. Liu Hong told the yamen
assistants Wang and Li to arrange a boat. Miss Yin went aboard with a trusted servant, the boatman pushed
off, and they headed for the Jinshan Temple.
On his return to the temple Xuanzang gave Abbot Faming a full account of what had happened. The abbot
was delighted. The next day a maid arrived at the temple to say that her mistress was coining to repay a vow,
and all the monks came out to welcome her. When Miss Yin came into the temple she prayed to the
Bodhisattva, offered a rich meal to the monks with a donation of money to each of them, and told her maid to
put the shoes and the summer socks into the offertory tray. She then went into the Buddha−hall and
worshipped with great devotion. When she told him to, Abbot Faming went away to distribute the gifts to the
monks. Xuanzang saw that all the other monks had gone and that there was nobody else in the Buddha−hall,
so he went up to his mother and knelt down. She told him to take off his shoes and socks and saw that one toe
was indeed missing from his left foot. The pair of them hugged each other and cried again, then they bowed to
the abbot to thank him for his kindness in bringing the boy up.
"I'm worried that the villain may get to know of your reunion," said the abbot, "so you had better go back as
quickly as you can to avoid trouble."
"My son," said Miss Yin, "I shall give you a sandalwood bracelet. You must go to a place called the Ten
Thousand Flowers Inn to the Northwest of Hongzhou, which is about five hundred miles from here, where we
left Madame Zhang, your paternal grandmother. I shall also write you a letter that you must take to the house
of the minister Yin Kaishan which lies to the left of the palace inside the capital city of the Tang Emperor. He
is my father. Give him this letter and ask him to submit a memorial to the Tang Emperor asking him to send
horse and foot to capture or kill that bandit. Then your father will be avenged and your mother will be
rescued. I must stay no longer as I am afraid that evil man may be suspicious if I am late back." She left the
temple and went back in her boat.
Xuanzang returned to the temple in tears and told the abbot that he was leaving at once for Hongzhou. When
he reached the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn he said to the innkeeper Liu the Second, "How is the mother of
Prefect Chen of Jiangzhou who is staying in your inn?"
"She used to stay here," replied the innkeeper. "She went blind, and as she didn't pay any rent for three or four
years, she now lives in a ruined tile−kiln near the Southern gate and begs in the streets every day to keep
herself alive. That official went away a very long time ago and she hasn't heard from him to this day, though I
don't know why." On learning this he asked the way to the ruined tile−kiln at the Southern gate and found his
grandmother.
"You sound like my son Chen Guangrui," said his grandmother.
"I'm not Chen Guangrui, I'm his son. My mother is Miss Yin Wenqiao."
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 122
"Why have your father and mother not come?" she asked; and he replied, "My father was murdered by a
brigand and my mother was forced to become his wife. I have a letter here and a sandalwood bracelet from
my mother." His grandmother took the letter and the bracelet, and sobbed aloud. "My son came here for the
sake of fame and glory. I thought that he had forgotten all feelings of decency and gratitude; it never occurred
to me that he might have been murdered. What a blessing that Heaven in its mercy did not cut short my son's
line, so that I now have a grandson to come and find me."
"How did you go blind, granny?" asked Xuanzang.
"I was always thinking of your father and longing for him to come back every day," she said, "but as he never
did I wept so much that! lost the sight of both my eyes." Xuanzang fell to his knees and prayed to Heaven.
"Although I am seventeen," he said, "I have been unable to avenge my parents. Today I have come on my
mother's orders and found my grandmother; if Heaven is at all moved by my sincerity, may my granny's eyes
see again." When he had prayed, he licked her eyes with the tip of his tongue. The licking soon opened them,
and they could see once more.
His grandmother looked at the little monk with a mixture of joy and sadness and said, "You really are my
grandson−−you're the very image of my son Guangrui." Xuanzang took her out of the kiln and reinstalled her
in Liu the Second's inn, where he rented a room for her, gave her some money to live on, and told her that he
would be back within a month.
Taking his leave of his grandmother, he went straight on to the capital, where he found Minister Yin's house
in the Eastern Avenue of the imperial city. "I am a relation of the minister's," he said to the gate−keeper, "and
I would like to see him."
When the gate−keeper reported this to the minister, he said, "I am no relation of any monk." But his wife said,
"I had a dream last night that our daughter Man−tang−qiao came home; perhaps he has a letter from our
son−in−law."
The minister had the young monk brought into the main hall, and when the monk saw the minister and his
wife he wept and bowed to the floor before them, then took an envelope out of his bosom and handed it to the
minister. The minister opened the letter and read it through, then wailed aloud.
"What's the matter, my lord?" asked his wife, and the minister replied, "This monk is our grandson. Our
son−in−law Chen Guangrui was murdered by a brigand, who forced Man−tang−qiao to become his wife." His
wife too began to weep bitterly when she heard this news.
"Try not to upset yourself, wife," said the minister. "I shall ask our sovereign at court tomorrow morning to be
allowed to lead an army myself. I shall certainly avenge our son−in−law."
The minister went to court the next day and wrote in a memorial to the Tang Emperor: "Your subject's
son−in−law, the top graduate Chen Guangrui, was murdered by the boatman Liu Hong while going with his
family to take up his office in Jiangzhou, and my daughter was forced to become his wife. This Liu Hong has
usurped office for many years by masquerading as my son−in−law. This constitutes treason. I beg Your
Majesty to dispatch horse and foot at once to destroy this rebellious brigand."
The Tang Emperor was so angry when he read this that he ordered Minister Yin to set off at the head of sixty
thousand men of the Imperial Guard. The minister left the court with the decree and went to the parade ground
to muster the soldiers before setting out for Jiangzhou. By setting out at dawn every day and not stopping till
night, they traveled as fast as a shooting star or a flying bird, and before they realized it they had reached
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 123
Jiangzhou, where Minister Yin's army camped on the Northern bank. That night he sent a messenger with a
gold−inscribed tablet to summon the deputy prefect and district judge of Jiangzhou. Minister Tin explained
the situation to them and told them to call out their troops to help him. They crossed the river together, and
surrounded Liu Hong's yamen before dawn. Liu Hong, who was still in his dreams, heard the sound of cannon
and the beating of drums and gongs; when the soldiers rushed his residence he was helpless and soon
captured. The minister ordered that Liu Hong and his gang should be tied up and taken to the execution
ground, while the army was to encamp outside the city walls.
The minister went into the main hall of the yamen and asked his daughter to come out and see him. His
daughter, who had been longing to go out, felt too ashamed to face her father and so was on the point of
hanging herself.
When Xuanzang learned of this he went as fast as he could to save her, fell on his knees, and said, "Your son
and my grandfather have come here with an army to avenge my father. That brigand has been arrested, so
there is no need at all for you to kill yourself. If you die mother, I won't be able to stay alive." The minister
too came into the residence to talk her out of it.
"They say that a woman should only have one husband in her life," she said to them. "I was bitterly grieved at
the death of my husband at that brigand's hands, and could not bear the disgrace of marrying his murderer; but
as I was carrying my husband's child I had to swallow the shame of staying alive. Now, thank goodness, my
son has grown up and my father has brought an army to avenge my husband but how could I have the face to
see you. The only way I can make up for it to my husband is to kill myself."
"My child," said the minister, "this was not a case of abandoning morality for the sake of material gain. You
acted under duress, and did nothing to be ashamed of." Father and daughter then embraced each other and
wept, while Xuanzang sobbed too. "There is no need for the two of you to be so distressed," said the minister,
wiping away his tears. "Today I have captured our enemy, that rebel, and now I must deal with him." He got
up and went to the execution ground.
As it happened, the assistant prefect of Jiangzhou had sent constables to arrest the other pirate, Li Biao, and
they brought him in. The minister was very pleased, and he ordered that Liu Hong and Li Biao were to be put
under a close guard. They were each given a hundred strokes of the heavy pole, and statements were taken
from them about how and why they had committed the wicked murder of Chen Guangrui. Then Li Biao was
nailed on a wooden donkey and pushed to the market−place, where he was sliced into a thousand pieces, after
which his head was hung up on public display. Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang Estuary where he had
murdered Chen Guangrui. The minister, his daughter and Xuanzang went to the riverside, where they made
offerings and libations to the emptiness and cut out Liu Hong's heart and liver while he was still alive to
sacrifice to Chen Guangrui. They also burnt a funerary address.
The bitter lamentations of the three of them startled the underwater palace. A patrolling yaksha demon handed
the funerary address to the dragon king. When he had read it, the dragon king sent Marshal Turtle to ask Chen
Guangrui to come and see him.
"Congratulations, sir, congratulations," said the dragon king. "Your lady, your son and your father−in−law are
all sacrificing to you on the bank. I shall now return your soul to you and give you an As−You−Will pearl,
two rolling pearls, ten pieces of mermaid silk, and a belt of jade studded with pearls. Today you will be
reunited with you wife, your son and your mother." Chen Guangrui bowed to him over and over again to
express his gratitude. The dragon king then told a yaksha to take Chen Guangrui's body out to the estuary,
where he was to return the soul to it; and the yaksha obediently went off.
Journey to the West
Chapter 9 124
When she had wailed for her husband and sacrificed to him, Miss Tin tried to jump into the water to drown
herself, but with a desperate effort Xuanzang managed to keep hold of her. Just at this tense moment they saw
a corpse floating towards the bank. Miss Yin, rushing forward to see who it was, recognized it as that of her
husband and started a great wailing. Everyone else had now come up to look, and they saw Chen Guangrui
open his fist and stretch his foot as his body gradually began to move. Suddenly he sat up, to their great
astonishment. He opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was his wife, his father−in−law and the young
monk all weeping beside him.
"What are you all doing here?" he asked.
"After you were killed I gave birth to this son," replied his wife, "and by a piece of good fortune he was
brought up by the abbot of the Jinshan Temple. When he came to find me I sent him to see my father; and
when my father knew what had happened he submitted a memorial at court and brought an army here to arrest
your murderer, whose heart and liver we have just plucked from his living body to sacrifice to you. But how is
it that your soul has been returned to you, husband?"
"It is all because we bought and released that golden carp when we were staying at the Ten Thousand Flowers
Inn: the carp, it turned out, was the local dragon king. When that treasonous murderer pushed me into the
water I was rescued by the dragon king, who has given me back my soul and presented me with all the
treasures I have on me. I never had any idea that you had borne this son, or that my father−in−law had
avenged me. Our sorrows are now at an end. This is a very happy moment indeed."
When the other officials heard what had happened they all came to offer their congratulations, and the
minister gave a banquet to thank all his subordinates. The army set off on its return journey that same day.
When they reached the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn the minister ordered them to encamp while Guangrui and
Xuanzang went to the inn to find the old lady. The night before she had dreamt of a withered tree blossoming
again while magpies made a clamorous din behind the building.
"Perhaps my grandson has come," she thought, and while the words were still in her mind she saw Guangrui
and his son at the gate of the inn.
"Isn't this my grandmother?" said the little monk; and the moment Guangrui saw his aged mother he
kowtowed to her. Mother and son embraced in tears; then he told her all about what had happened. The
innkeeper's account was presented and settled, and then they set off for the capital. When they reached the
minister's residence, Guangrui, his wife, his mother and Xuanzang all went in to see the minister's wife, who
was overcome with joy and told the servants to lay on a large banquet to celebrate.
"We can call today's banquet a 'reunion banquet,'" said the minister, and the whole household was indeed
happy.
When the Tang Emperor entered the throne hall early the next morning, Minister Yin stepped forward and
submitted a memorial giving a detailed account of what had happened, and recommending Chen Guangrui as
a man whose talents could be put to great use. The Tang Emperor approved the memorial and ordered that
Chen Guangrui should be appointed a Scholar in order to take part in administration at court. As Xuanzang
had decided to follow the contemplative life he was sent to cultivate his conduct in the Hongfu Temple. Later
on Miss Yin finally ended her life in a quiet and honorable way, and Xuanzang went back to the Jinshan
Temple to report to Abbot Faming. If you don't know what happened afterwards, listen to the explanation in
the next installment.

With a Stupid Plan the Dragon King Breaks the Laws of Heaven
Minister Wei Sends a Letter to an Officer of Hell
We shall not discuss how Chen Guangrui performed his duties or Xuanzang cultivated his conduct; instead we
shall talk about two wise men who lived beside the banks of the River Jing outside the city of Chang'an. One
was an old fisherman called Zhang Shao and the other was a woodcutter called Li Ding. They were both
advanced scholars who had never taken the official examination, lettered men of the mountains. One day,
when Li Ding had sold his load of firewood and Zhang Shao had sold his basketful of carp in Chang'an city,
they went into a tavern, drank till they were half tipsy, and strolled slowly home along the banks of the Jing,
each holding a bottle in his hand.
"Brother Li," said Zhang Shao, "it seems to me that people who struggle for fame kill themselves for it; those
who compete for profit die for it; those who accept honors sleep with a tiger in their arms; and those who
receive imperial favours walk around with snakes in their sleeves. Taking all in all, we are much better off
living free among our clear waters and blue hills: we delight in our poverty and follow our destinies."
"You are right, Brother Zhang," said Li Ding, "but your clear waters have nothing on my blue hills."
"Your blue hills are not a patch on my clear waters," retorted Zhang Shao, "and here is a lyric to the tune of
The Butterfly Loves the Flowers to prove it:
The skiff is tiny amid the misty expanse of waves;
Calmly I lean against the single sail,
Listening to the voice of Xishi the beauty.
My thoughts and mind are cleared; I have no wealth or fame
As I toy with the waterweed and the rushes.
"To count a few gulls makes the journey happy.
In the reedy bend, under the willow bank,
My wife and children smile with me.
The moment I fall asleep, wind and waves are quiet;
No glory, no disgrace, and not a single worry."
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 126
"Your clear waters are no match for my blue hills," said Li Ding, "and there is another lyric to the same tune
to prove it. It goes:
The cloudy woods are covered with pine blossom.
Hush! Hear the oriole sing,
As if it played a pipe with its cunning tongue.
With touches of red and ample green the spring is warm;
Suddenly the summer's here as the seasons turn.
"When autumn comes the look of things is changed;
The scented chrysanthemum
Is enough for my pleasure.
Soon the cruel winter plucks all off.
I am free through four seasons, at nobody's beck and call."
"You don't enjoy the good things in your blue hills that I do on my clear waters," replied the fisherman, "and I
can prove it with another lyric to the tune of The Partridge Heaven:
In this magic land we live off the cloudy waters;
With a sweep of the oar the boat becomes a home.
We cut open the live fish and fry the green turtle
As steam coils from the purple crab and the red shrimps bubble.
Green reed shoots,
Sprouts of water−lilies,
Better still, water chestnuts and the gorgon fruit,
Delicate louts roots and seeds, tender celery,
Arrowhead, reed−hearts and bird−glory blossom."
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 127
"Your clear waters cannot compare with my blue hills when it comes to the good things they provide," said
the woodcutter, and I can cite another lyric to the tune The Partridge Heaven as evidence:
Mighty crags and towering peaks reach to the sky;
A grass hut or a thatched cottage is my home.
Pickled chicken and duck are better than turtles or crabs,
Roebuck, boar, venison, and hare beat fish and shrimps.
The leaves of the tree of heaven,
Yellow chinaberry sprouts,
And, even better, bamboo shoots and wild tea,
Purple plums and red peaches, ripe gages, and apricots,
Sweet pears, sharp jujubes, and osmanthus blossom."
"Your blue hills are really nothing on my clear waters," replied the fisherman, "and there is another lyric to
the tune Heavenly Immortal:
In my little boat I can stay where I like,
Having no fear of the many misty waves.
Drop the hook, cast wide the net, to catch fresh fish:
Even without fat or sauce,
They taste delicious
As the whole family eats its meal together.
"When there are fish to spare I sell them in Chang'an market
To buy good liquor and get a little drunk.
Covered with my grass cloak I sleep on the autumn river,
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 128
Snoring soundly
Without a care,
Not giving a damn for honour and glory."
"Your clear waters still aren't as good as my blue mountains," came back the woodcutter, "and I too have a
Heavenly Immortal lyric to prove it:
Where I build a little thatched hut under the hill
The bamboo, orchid, plum, and pine are wonderful.
As I cross forests and mountains to look for dry firewood
Nobody asks awkward questions,
And I can sell
As much or as little as the world wants.
I spend the money on wine and I'm happy,
Content with my earthenware bowl and china jug.
When I've drunk myself blotto I lie in the shade of the pine.
No worries,
No books to balance;
What do I care about success or failure?"
"Brother Li," said the fisherman, "you don't make as easy a living in the hills as I do on the water, and I can
prove it with a lyric to the tune The Moon on the West River:
The smartweed's flowers are picked out by the moon
While the tangled leaves of rushes sway in the wind.
Clear and distant the azure sky, empty the Chu river:
Stir up the water, and the stars dance.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 129
Big fish swim into the net in shoals;
Little ones swallow the hooks in swarms;
Boiled or fried they taste wonderful−−
I laugh at the roaring river and lake."
"Brother Zhang," replied the woodcutter, "the living I make in the hills is much easier than yours on the water,
and I can prove it with another Moon on the West River lyric:
Withered and leafless rattan fills the paths,
Old bamboo with broken tips covers the hillside.
Where vines and creepers tangle and climb
I pull some off to tie my bundles.
Elms and willows hollow with decay,
Pines and cedars cracked by the wind−−
I stack them up against the winter cold,
And whether they're sold for wine or money is up to me."
"Although you don't do too badly in your hills, your life is not as elegant as mine on the water," said the
fisherman, "as I can show with some lines to the tune The Immortal by the River.
As the tide turns my solitary boat departs;
I sing in the night, resting from the oars.
From under a straw cape the waning moon is peaceful.
The sleeping gulls are not disturbed
As the clouds part at the end of the sky.
Tired, I lie on the isle of rushes with nothing to do,
And when the sun is high I'm lying there still.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 130
I arrange everything to suit myself:
How can the court official compare with my ease
As he waits in the cold for an audience at dawn?"
"Your life on the water may be elegant, but it's nothing compared with mine," replied the woodcutter, "and I
have some lines to the same tune to demonstrate the point:
On an autumn day I carry my axe along the greeny path
Bringing the load back in the cool of evening,
Putting wild flowers in my hair, just to be different,
I push aside the clouds to find my way home,
And the moon is up when I tell them to open the door.
Rustic wife and innocent son greet me with smiles,
And I recline on my bed of grass and wooden pillow.
Steamed millet and pear are spread before me,
While the new wine is warm in the pot: This is really civilized."
"All this is about our living and the ways we provide for ourselves," said the fisherman. "I can prove to you
that your leisure is nowhere near as good as mine with a poem that goes:
Idly I watch the white cranes as they cross the sky;
As I Moor the boat at the river's bank, a blue door gives me shade.
Leaning on the sail I teach my son to twist a fishing line,
When rowing's done I dry the nets out with my wife.
A settled nature can really know the calm of the waves;
A still body feels the lightness of the breeze.
Always to wear a green straw cape and a blue straw hat
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 131
Is better than the purple robes of the court."
"Your leisure doesn't come up to mine," replied the woodcutter, "as this poem I shall now recite demonstrates:
With a lazy eye on the white clouds in the distance,
I sit alone in a thatched but, then close the bamboo door.
When there's nothing to do I teach my son to read;
Sometimes a visitor comes and we play a game of chess.
When I'm happy I take my stick and walk singing along the paths,
Or carry my lute up the emerald hills.
Grass shoes with hempen thongs, a cloak of coarsest cloth,
A mind relaxed: better than wearing silk."
"Li Ding," said the other, "how truly it can be said of us that 'by reciting some verses we become close
friends: What need for golden winecups and a sandalwood table?' But there is nothing remarkable in just
reciting verses; what would you say if we made couplets in which we each contributed a line about our lives
as fisherman and woodcutter?"
"Brother Zhang," said Li Ding, "that is an excellent suggestion. Please be the one to start." Here are their
couplets:
My boat is moored in the green waters amid the misty waves;
My home is in the wilds, deep in the mountains.
How well I like the swollen stream under the bridge in spring;
My delight is a mountain peak swathed in clouds at dawn.
Dragon−sized fresh carp cooked at any time;
Dry, rotten, firewood always keeps one warm.
A full array of hooks and nets to support my old age;
Carrying wood and making twine will keep me till I die.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 132
Lying back in a tiny boat watching the flying geese;
Reclining beside the grassy path and hearing the wild swans call.
I have no stall in the marketplace of tongues;
I've left no trace in the sea of disputation.
The nets hung to dry beside the brook are like brocade;
An axe well honed on rock is sharper than a spear.
Under the shining autumn moon I often fish alone;
I meet nobody on the solitary mountain in spring.
I trade my surplus fish for wine and drink it with my wife;
When I've wood to spare I buy a bottle and share it with my sons.
Singing and musing to myself I'm as wild as I care to be;
Long songs, long sighs, I can let myself be crazy.
I invite my brothers and cousins and fellow boatmen;
Leading my friends by the hand I meet the old man of the wilds.
As we play guess−fingers the cups fly fast;
When we make riddles the goblets slowly circulate.
Saute or boiled crab is a delight every morning;
Plenty of fried duck and chicken cooked in ashes every day.
As my simple wife brews tea, my spirits are untrammelled;
While my mountain spouse cooks supper, my mind is at ease.
At the coming of dawn I wash my stick in the ripples;
When the sun rises I carry firewood across the road.
After the rain I put on my cloak to catch live carp;
I wield my axe before the wind to fell a withered pine.
I cover my tracks and hide from the world, acting the imbecile;
I change my name and pretend to be deaf and dumb.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 133
"Brother Li," said Zhang Shao. "I unfairly took the first lines just now, so now it's your turn to compose the
first lines while I follow you." Thus they continued:
The man of the mountains acting mad under wind and moon;
The haughty and unwanted dotard of the river.
With his share of idleness, and able to be quite free;
No sound from his voice as he revels in his peace.
On moonlit nights he sleeps secure in a cottage of thatch;
He lightly covers himself at dusk with clothes of reed.
His passion spent, he befriends the pine and the plum;
He is happy to be the companion of cormorant and gull.
Fame and profit count for nothing in his mind;
His ears have never heard the clash of arms.
One is always pouring out fresh rice−wine,
The other has wild vegetable soup with every meal.
One makes a living with two bundles of firewood;
The other supports himself with rod and line.
One idly tells his innocent son to sharpen the axe of steel;
The other quietly bids his slow−witted child to mend the nets.
In spring one likes to see the willows turning green;
When the seasons change the other enjoys the rushes' blue.
Avoiding the summer heat, one trims the new bamboo;
The other gathers water−chestnuts on cool July evenings.
When frost begins, plump chickens are killed each day;
In mid−autumn the crabs are at their best and always in the pot.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 134
When the sun rises in winter, the one is still asleep;
The other keeps cool in the dog days of summer.
Throughout the year one does as he pleases in the hills;
In all four seasons the other is happy on the lake.
By gathering firewood you can become an Immortal;
There is nothing worldly about fishing.
Sweet smell the wild flowers growing outside my door;
Smooth are the green waves lapping at my boat.
A contented man never speaks of high honors;
A settled nature is stronger than a city wall.
Higher than a city wall for resisting enemy armies;
More illustrious than holding high office and listening to imperial decrees.
Those who are happy with mountains and rivers are few indeed;
Thank Heaven, thank Earth, and thank the spirits.
When the two of them had recited their verses and matched couplets they came to the place where their ways
parted and bowed to each other to take their leave. "Brother Li," said Zhang Shao, "look after yourself on your
way home and keep a sharp look−out for tigers up in the hills. If you met with an accident then 'an old friend
would be missing on the road tomorrow.'" This made Li Ding angry.
"You scoundrel," he said, "I'm your friend; I'd die for you. How could you put such a curse on me? If I'm
killed by a tiger, you'll be capsized by a wave."
"I'll never be capsized!" retorted Zhang Shao.
"'In nature there are unexpected storms and in life unpredictable vicissitudes,'" quoted Li Ding, "so how can
you be sure you'll never have an accident?"
"Brother Zhang," replied the fisherman, "despite what you just said, it's your life that's insecure, whereas my
life is certain: I'm sure that I shan't have an accident."
"Your life on the water is very dangerous and insecure," said the woodcutter, "so how can you be so certain?"
"There's something you don't know," said Zhang Shao. "Every day I give a golden carp to a fortune−teller on
the West Gate Street in Chang'an, and he passes a slip into my sleeve telling me I'll catch something every
time provided I go to the right place. I went to buy a forecast from him today, and he told me that if I cast my
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 135
nets to the East of the bend in the Jing River and lowered my lines on the Western bank, I would be bound to
get a full load of fish and shrimps to take home. Tomorrow I shall go into town to sell them to buy wine, and
we can continue our talk then, brother." With this they parted.
How true it is that if you talk on the road there will be someone listening in the grass. A patrolling yaksha
from the Jing River Palace overheard Zhang Shao's remark about always catching fish and rushed straight
back to the palace of crystal to make an urgent report of disaster to the dragon king.
"What disaster?" asked the dragon king, and the yaksha replied, "Your subject was patrolling in the water by
the river's edge when I heard a fisherman and a woodcutter talking. Just when they were parting they sounded
very dangerous. The fisherman said that there is a soothsayer on West Gate Street in Chang'an city whose
predictions are very accurate. The fisherman gives him a golden carp every day, and he hands the fisherman a
slip saying that he'll catch fish at every attempt. If his calculations are so accurate, won't all we water folk be
wiped out? Shall we fortify the water palace, or shall we make some leaping waves to strengthen Your
Majesty's prestige?"
The dragon king seized his sword in a great rage, intending to go straight to Chang'an city and destroy this
fortune−teller, but then his dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp officials, crab soldiers, shad generals,
mandarin−fish ministers, and carp premier submitted a joint memorial that read: "We beg Your Majesty not to
act in anger. As the saying goes, 'words overheard are not to be trusted.' If Your Majesty were to go now you
would have to be accompanied by clouds and helped by rain; and if this frightens the common people of
Chang'an, Heaven may take offence. Your Majesty is capable of making all sorts of transformations, and of
appearing and vanishing unexpectedly; so you should change into a scholar for this visit to Chang'an. If you
find that it is true, you will be able to punish him at your leisure; and if it turns out to be false, you will avoid
killing an innocent man." Taking their advice, the dragon king put aside his sword, and without raising clouds
or rain he climbed out on the back, shook himself, and turned into a scholar dressed in white. He was
Handsome and noble,
Towering into the clouds.
His step was stately
And he observed the rules of conduct.
In his speech he showed his respect for Confucius and Mencius,
His manners were those of the Duke of Zhou and King Wen.
He wore a gown of jade−green silk,
A cloth wrapped casually round his head.
Once on the road he strode straight to West Gate Street in Chang'an city, where he saw a crowd of people
pushing and shouting. One of them was proclaiming grandiloquently, "He who was born under the Dragon
will clash with the one who belongs to the Tiger. Although the cyclical characters are supposed to be in
concordance, I'm afraid that the Year Planet may be offended by the Sun." As soon as he heard this the dragon
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 136
king knew that this was the place where fortunes were told, so he pushed through the crowds to look inside.
He saw:
Four walls covered with pearls,
A room full of silken embroideries,
Incense ever rising from a burner,
Clear water in a porcelain pot.
On either side were paintings by Wang Wei;
High above the seat hung a picture of the Devil Valley Hermit.
An inkstone from Duanxi County,
"Golden smoke" ink,
On which leant a large brush of finest hairs;
A forest of fiery pearls,
The prediction of Guo Pu,
As he diligently compared them to the Tai Zheng Xin Jing.
He was deeply versed in the six lines of the diagrams,
A great expert on the Eight Trigrams.
He understood the principles of Heaven and Earth,
And saw into the feelings of gods and devils.
He knew all about the cyclical numbers,
And had a clear picture of the constellations.
He saw the events of the future,
The events of the past,
As if in a mirror.
Which house would rise,
Which house would fall,
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 137
He could tell with divine perception.
He knew when good and bad was coming,
Could predict death and survival.
His words hastened wind and rain;
When he wielded his writing−brush, gods and devils trembled.
His name was written on a signboard:
Master of Divination Yuan Shoucheng.
Who was he? He was Yuan Shoucheng, the uncle of Yuan Tiangang the Imperial Astrologer. He was famous
throughout the country, and the leading member of his profession in Chang'an. The dragon king went in to see
him, and when they had greeted each other he asked the dragon king to sit down, while a servant brought tea.
"What have you come to ask about, sir?" asked the soothsayer, and the dragon king replied, "I beg you to
uncover the secrets of the sky for me." The soothsayer passed him a slip of paper from his sleeve and said,
"Clouds obscure the mountain peak, mist covers the tree tops. If there is to be rain, it will certainly come
tomorrow."
"When will it rain tomorrow," asked the dragon king, "and how many inches of rain will fall?"
"Tomorrow the clouds will gather at mid−morning; late in the morning there will be thunder; at noon it will
start to rain; and in the early afternoon the rain will finish, after 3 feet 3.48 inches have fallen," replied the
soothsayer.
"I trust that you are not fooling," said the dragon king. "If it rains tomorrow at the time and to the depth you
have predicted I shall pay you a fee of fifty pieces of gold. If it does not rain, or if it does not rain at the time
and to the depth you say it will, then I'm telling you straight that I'll smash up your shopfront, tear down your
sign and run you out of Chang'an so that you won't be able to deceive the people a moment longer."
"That is entirely up to you," replied the other cheerfully. "We shall meet again tomorrow after the rain."
The dragon king took his leave and went back to his watery palace from Chang'an. The greater and lesser
water spirits greeted him with the question, "How did Your Majesty's visit to the soothsayer go?"
"It was all right," he replied, "but he was a smooth−tongued fortune−teller. When I asked him when it would
rain, he said tomorrow. When I asked what time of day it would be and how much would fall, he said that at
mid−morning the clouds would gather, late in the morning it would thunder, at noon it would start to rain, and
early in the afternoon it would stop raining. He also said that 3 feet 3.48 inches of rain would fall. I made a
wager with him that if his prediction turned out to be true, I'd give him fifty ounces of gold; but if he got it at
all wrong, I'd smash up his shopfront id drive him out, so that he wouldn't be able to deceive the public any
longer. The watery tribe laughed and said, "Your Majesty is the General Superintendent of the Eight Rivers
and the Great Dragon God of the Rain, so only you can know whether there will be rain. How dare he talk
such nonsense? That fortune−teller is bound to lose, absolutely bound to."
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 138
Just as all the dragon sons and grandsons were laughing and talking about this with the fish ministers and crab
soldiers a shout was heard from the sky: "Dragon King of the Jing River, prepare to receive an Imperial
Decree." They all looked up and saw a warrior in golden clothes coming towards the watery palace with a
decree from the Jade Emperor in his hands. This alarmed the dragon king, who straightened his clothes, stood
up solemnly, burnt incense and received the decree. The gold−clad warrior returned to the sky. Giving thanks
for the imperial grace the dragon king opened the letter and read:
"We order the Superintendent of the Eight Rivers to travel with thunder and lightning and succor the city of
Chang'an with rain."
The time and the amount on the decree were exactly the same as those foretold by the soothsayer, which so
startled the dragon king that he passed out. When he came round a moment later he said to the watery tribe,
"How can there be a man of such powers in the mortal world? He is really someone who knows everything
about Heaven and Earth−−I'm bound to be beaten by him."
"Your Majesty should not worry," submitted General Shad in a memorial. "There will be no difficulty about
beating him. Your subject has a humble plan that I can guarantee will shut that scoundrel's mouth." When the
dragon king asked what the plan was, the general replied, "Make it rain at the wrong time and not quite
enough, so that his predictions are wrong, and then you will surely beat him. There will be nothing to stop you
smashing his sign to smithereens and running him out of town." The dragon king accepted his advice and
stopped worrying.
The next day he ordered Viscount Wind, Duke Thunder, the Cloud Youth and Mother Lightning to go to the
sky above the city of Chang'an. He waited till late in the morning before spreading the clouds, unleashed the
thunder at noon, started the rain in the early afternoon, and stopped it in the late afternoon, when only three
feet and 0.4 inches had fallen. He had thus changed the times by two hours and reduced the amount of rain by
.08 inches. After the rain he dismissed his generals and his hosts and put away his clouds; then he changed
back into a white−clad scholar and charged into Yuan Shoucheng's fortune−telling stall on West Gate Street.
Without even asking for an explanation he smashed up Yuan's sign, his brush, his inkstone, and everything
else, while the fortune−teller remained calmly in his chair without moving.
The dragon king brandished the door in the air, ready to hit him with it, and began to pour abuse on him: "You
evil man, with all your reckless talk about blessings and disasters; you stinking deceiver of the masses. Your
predictions are false, and you talk nonsense. You got the time and the amount of today's rain quite wrong, but
you still sit there so high and mighty. Get out at once if you want me to spare your life." Yuan Shoucheng,
who was as calm and unfrightened as ever, looked up to the sky with a mocking smile.
"I'm not afraid," he said, "I'm not afraid. I've committed no capital offence, but I fear that you have. You may
be able to fool other people, but you can't fool me. I know who you are. You're no scholar; you're the Dragon
King of the River Jing. You flouted a decree of the Jade Emperor by changing the time of the rain and cutting
down the amount, which is a crime against the laws of Heaven. I'm afraid that you're for the executioner's
blade on the Dragon−slicing Scaffold. Are you going to keep up that abuse of me?"
On hearing this the dragon king trembled from fear and his hair stood on end. Dropping the door at once he
straightened his clothes and made gestures of submission, kneeling to the soothsayer and saying, "Please do
not be angry with me, sir; I was only joking. I never thought that it would be taken seriously. Whatever am I
to do if I have broken the laws of Heaven? I beg you to save me, sir. If you don't I shall haunt you after my
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 139
death."
"I can't save you," replied Yuan Shoucheng, "but I can suggest one way by which you may be able to save
your skin."
"I beg you to tell me," implored the dragon king.
"Tomorrow afternoon at half past one you will have to go to the office of the official in charge of personnel,
Wei Zheng, to be beheaded. If you want to stay alive you must report at once to the present Tang Emperor,
Taizong, as Wei Zheng is a minister of his; and if you can get him to speak for you, you will be all right." The
dragon king took his leave of the soothsayer with tears in his eyes and went away. The sun was setting in the
West, and the moon and stars were coming out.
As clouds settle round the mountains the crows fly back to roost,
The travelers on long journeys find inns for the night.
The returning geese sleep on a sandbank by the ford,
As the Milky Way appears.
While the hours push on
A lamp in the lonely village burns with barely a flame.
Pure is the monastery as the reed smoke curls in the breeze;
Men disappear in the butterfly dream.
As the moon sinks, flower shadows climb the rails,
The stars are a jumble of light.
The hours are called,
The night is already half way through.
The Dragon King of the River Jing did not return to his watery palace but stayed in the sky until the small
hours of the morning, when he put away his cloud and his mist horn, and went straight to the gate of the
Imperial Palace. At this very moment the Tang Emperor dreamt that he went out of the palace gate to stroll
among the flowers in the moonlight. The dragon king at once took human form, went up to him and knelt and
bowed before him, crying, "Save me, Your Majesty, save me."
"Who are you, that we should save you?" asked Taizong.
"Your Majesty is a true dragon," replied the dragon king, "and I am a wicked dragon. As I have offended
against the laws of Heaven, I am due to be beheaded by Your Majesty's illustrious minister Wei Zheng, the
official in charge of personnel, so I have come to beg you to save me."
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 140
"If you are supposed to be beheaded by Wei Zheng, we can save you, so set your mind at rest and go along
now," said the Tang Emperor. The dragon king, who was extremely happy, kowtowed in thanks and went
away.
Taizong remembered his dream when he woke up. It was now half past four in the morning, so Taizong held
court before the assembled civil and military officials.
Mist wreathed the palace gates,
Incense rose to the dragon towers.
In the shimmering light the silken screen moves,
As the clouds shake the imperial glory spreads.
Monarch and subject as faithful as Yao and Shun,
Imposing music and ritual rivaling Zhou and Han.
Pages hold lanterns,
Palace women hold fans,
In brilliant pairs.
Pheasant screens,
Unicorn halls,
Shimmering everywhere.
As the call "Long Live the Emperor" goes up,
The Empress is wished a thousand autumns.
When the Rod of Silence descends three times,
The uniformed officials bow to the emperor.
The brightly coloured palace flowers have a heavenly scent;
The delicate willows on the bank sing royal songs.
Pearl curtains,
Jade curtains,
Are hung high from golden hooks;
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 141
Dragon and phoenix fans,
Landscape fans,
Rest by the royal chariot.
Elegant are the civil officials,
Vigorous the generals.
By the Imperial Way high and low are divided;
They stand by rank beneath the palace steps.
The ministers with their purple corded seals ride three elephants.
May the Emperor live as long as Heaven and Earth!
When the officials had all done homage they divided into their groups. The Tang Emperor looked at them one
by one with his dragon and phoenix eyes. Among the civil officials he observed Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui,
Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui and others; and among the military officers he saw Ma Sanbao, Duan
Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaojin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, and Qin Shubao among others. Every one of
them was standing there solemnly and with dignity, but he could not see Minister Wei Zheng among them.
He summoned Xu Shiji into the palace hall and said to him, "We had a strange dream last night in which a
man came and bowed to us, claiming that he was the Dragon King of the River Jing. He had broken the laws
of Heaven, and was due to be beheaded by the official in the personnel department, Wei Zheng. He begged us
to save him, and we agreed. Why is it that the only official missing at court today is Wei Zheng?"
"If this dream is true," replied Xu Shiji, "Wei Zheng must be summoned to the palace, and Your Majesty must
not let him out of doors. Once today is over the Dragon King will be saved." The Tang Emperor was
overjoyed and he sent a personal aide with a decree summoning Wei Zheng to court.
That night the minister Wei Zheng had been reading the stars in his residence and was just burning some
precious incense when he heard a crane calling in the sky. It was a messenger from Heaven with a decree
from the Jade Emperor ordering him to behead the Dragon King of the River Jing in a dream at half past one
the following afternoon. The minister thanked Heaven for its grace, fasted and bathed himself, tried out the
sword of his wisdom, and exercised his soul. This was why he did not go to court. When the imperial aide
came with a summons he was frightened and nonplussed; but he did not dare to delay in obeying an order
from his monarch, so he hurriedly tidied his clothes, tightened his belt, and went to the palace with the
summons in his hands. He kowtowed to the Emperor and admitted his fault.
"We forgive you," said the Emperor. The officials had not yet withdrawn, so the Emperor now ordered the
curtains to be lowered and dismissed them. The only one of them he kept behind was Wei Zheng, whom he
ordered to mount the golden chariot and come to his private quarters with him, where they discussed the
policies to bring peace and stability to the country.
At about noon he ordered the palace ladies to bring a large weiqi chess set and said, "We shall now have a
game of chess." The Imperial concubines brought in a chess board and set it on the Emperor's table. Thanking

the Tang Emperor for his grace, Wei Zheng started to play with him. As each moved in turn they built up their
lines of battle. It was just as the Chess Classic says:
The Way of chess:
The best place is the middle of the board,
The worst is the side,
And the comers are neither good nor bad.
This is the eternal law of chess.
The law says:
"It is better to lose a piece
Than to lose the initiative.
When you are struck on the left, look to the right,
When attacked in the rear, keep an eye on your front.
Sometimes the leader is really behind,
Sometimes the laggard is really ahead.
If you have two 'live' areas do not let them be severed;
If you can survive as you are, do not link up.
Do not spread yourself out too thinly,
Do not crowd your pieces too closely.
Rather than being niggardly with your pieces,
Lose them and win the game.
Rather than moving for no reason,
It is better to strengthen your position.
When he has many and you have few,
Concentrate on survival;
When you have many and he has few,
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 143
Extend your positions.
The one who is good at winning does not have to struggle;
The one who draws up a good position does not have to fight;
The one who fights well does not lose;
The one who loses well is not thrown into confusion.
Open your game with conventional gambits,
And end by winning with surprise attacks.
When the enemy strengthens himself for no apparent reason,
He is planning to attack and cut you off.
When he abandons small areas and does not rescue them
His ambitions are great.
The man who places his pieces at random
Has no plans;
The man who responds without thinking
Is heading for defeat.
The Book of Songs says:
"Be cautious and careful
As if you were walking on the edge of a precipice.'
This is what it means."
There is a poem that goes:
The board is the Earth, the chessmen Heaven,
The colours, Positive and Negative,
When you reach that subtle state when all the changes become clear,
You can laugh and brag about the chess−playing Immortals.

Chapter 10 144
As sovereign and minister played their game of chess it was half past one. Although the game was not over,
Wei Zheng slumped down beside the table and started to snore, fast asleep.
"Worthy Minister," said Taizong with a smile, "you have exhausted your mind in strengthening the country
and tired yourself out building the empire; that is why you have fallen asleep without realizing it." The
Emperor said no more and let him sleep. Not long afterwards Wei Zheng woke up, prostrated himself on the
floor, and said, "Your subject deserves ten thousand deaths. I fell asleep without knowing what I was doing,
and I beg Your Majesty to forgive your subject's criminal discourtesy to his sovereign."
"What criminal discourtesy have you committed?" the Emperor asked. "Rise, and take the Pieces off the board
so that we may start again." Wei Zheng thanked him for his grace, and was just taking the pieces in his hand
when he heard shouting outside the palace gates. Qin Shubao, Xu Maogong and some others brought in a
dragon's head dripping with blood, threw it to the floor in front of the Emperor, and reported, "Your Majesty,
Seas have gone shallow and rivers have run dry,
But such a sight as this was never seen by human eye."
The Emperor and Wei Zheng rose to their feet and asked where it had come from.
"This dragon's head fell from a cloud at the crossroads at the end of the Thousand Yard Portico, and your
humble subjects dared not fail to report it," said Qin Shubao and Xu Maogong.
"What does this mean?" the Tang Emperor asked Wei Zheng in astonishment.
"Your subject beheaded it in a dream just now," replied Wei Zheng, kowtowing.
"But I never saw you move your hand or body when you were dozing," said the shocked Emperor, "and you
had no sword, so how could you have beheaded it?"
"My lord," replied Wei Zheng, "your subject
Was bodily in your presence,
But far away in my dream.
I was bodily in your presence reaching the end of a game.
When I shut my eyes and felt drowsy;
I went far away in my dream, riding a magic cloud,
Bursting with energy.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 145
That dragon
Was on the Dragon−slicing Scaffold
Where he had been tied by the officers and soldiers of Heaven.
Then your minister said,
'You have broken the laws of Heaven,
And deserve the death penalty.
I bear a heavenly mandate
To behead you.'
When the dragon heard he was bitterly grieved;
Your subject marshalled his spirits.
When the dragon heard he was bitterly grieved,
Pulled in his claws, laid down his scales and gladly prepared to die.
Your subject marshalled his spirits,
Hitched up his clothes, stepped forward and raised the blade.
With a snick the sword came down,
And the dragon's head fell into the void."
Emperor Taizong's feelings on hearing this were mixed. On the one hand he was happy, because he was proud
of having so good a minister as Wei Zheng; for with a hero like that in his court he needed to have no worries
about the safety of the empire. On the other hand he was distressed, because although he had promised in his
dream to save the dragon, it had been executed. He had no choice but to pull himself together and order Qin
Shubao to hang the dragon's head up in the market place as a warning to the common people of Chang'an. He
also rewarded Wei Zheng, and then all the officials dispersed.
When he returned to the palace that evening, the Emperor was depressed as he remembered how the dragon
had wept so bitterly in his dream, begging to be saved. Yet the dragon had been unable to avoid its doom.
After brooding over this for a long time he felt more and more exhausted and uneasy. In the second watch of
the night he heard sobbing outside the palace gates, which made him more frightened than ever. As he lay in a
fitful sleep, the dragon king of the River Jing reappeared, this time holding a head dripping with blood in his
hands.
"Emperor Taizong of the Tang," he shouted, "give me back my life, give me back my life. Last night you were
full of promises to save me, so why did you double−cross me yesterday and order Wei Zheng, the official in
charge of personnel, to behead me? Come out, come out, and we shall go to the King of Hell's place to have
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 146
this out." He pulled at the Emperor's clothes and would not stop shouting. Taizong could find nothing to say,
and struggled so hard to get away that he was pouring with sweat. Just at this most awkward moment he saw
fragrant clouds and coloured mists to the South. A female Immortal came forward and waved a willow twig,
at which the headless dragon went off to the Northwest, weeping pitifully. This Immortal was the Bodhisattva
Guanyin, who had come to the East in obedience to the Buddha's decree to find the man to fetch the
scriptures. She was now staying in the temple of the tutelary god of Chang'an, and when she heard the devilish
howling she came to chase away the wicked dragon. The dragon then went down to Hell to submit a full
report.
When Taizong woke up he shouted, "A ghost, a ghost!" The empresses of the three palaces, the imperial
consorts and concubines of the six compounds, the attendants and the eunuchs were all so terrified by this that
they lay awake trembling for the rest of the night. Before long it was half past four, and all the military and
civil officials were waiting for the morning court outside the palace gates. When dawn came and the Emperor
had still not come to court they were so frightened that they did not know what to do.
It was not till the sun was high in the sky that a decree was brought out that read, "As our mind is not at ease
all the officials are excused court." Six or seven days quickly passed, and all the officials were so anxious that
they wished they could rush to the palace gates to see the Emperor and ask after his health, but all that
happened was that the Empress issued a decree summoning the royal doctors to the palace to administer
medicine. Crowds of officials gathered at the palace gates waiting for news, and when the doctors came out a
little later they asked what the matter was.
"His Majesty's pulse in not as it should be: it is both faint and fast. He murmurs deliriously about having seen
a ghost. His pulse stops every ten beats. His five viscera lack all spirit, and I am afraid that the worst must be
expected within seven days." The officials went pale from shock.
Amid all the panic it was learned that Taizong had sent for Xu Maogong, the Duke Protector Qin Shubao, and
Lord Yuchi Jingde. When the three lords received the decree they hurried to the lower story of the side palace.
When they had bowed to him, a serious−faced Taizong spoke forcefully to them.
"Illustrious ministers," he said, "we started to command troops at the age of nineteen, and had many hard
years of fighting from then on, conquering the North and the South, defending in the East, and wiping out our
enemies in the West; but never once did we see anything sinister or evil. Yet now we are seeing ghosts."
"Your Majesty has founded an empire and slaughtered men beyond number, so why should you be scared of
ghosts?" asked Lord Yuchi.
"You don't believe us," the Emperor replied, "but outside our bedroom door at night bricks and tiles fly about
and the ghosts and demons howl. It is really terrible. Daytime is passable, but the nights are unbearable."
"Don't worry, Your Majesty," said Qin Shubao. "Tonight I and Yuchi Jingde shall guard the palace doors to
see whether there are any ghosts or not." Taizong agreed to his suggestion, and after thanking him for his
kindness Xu Maogong and the other two generals withdrew. That evening the two of them put on their
equipment and took up their positions outside the palace gates in full armour and helmet, with golden maces
and battle−axes in their hands. Look how these splendid generals were dressed:
On their heads were golden helmets bright,
On their bodies was armour like dragon scales.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 147
Magic clouds glisten in front of their Heart−protecting Mirrors;
Their lion coats are tightly buckled.
Fresh are the colours of their embroidered belts.
One looks up to the sky with his phoenix eyes, and the stars tremble;
The other's eyes flash lightning and dim the moonlight.
These true heroes and distinguished ministers
Will be called gate−protectors for a thousand years
And serve as door−gods for ten thousand ages.
The two generals stood beside the doors till deep into the night, and not a single demon did they see. That
night Taizong slept peacefully in the palace and nothing happened. When morning came he called the two
generals in and gave them rich rewards.
"We had not been able to sleep for several days since we fell ill," he said, "but last night was very peaceful,
thanks to the awesome might of you two generals. Please go and rest now so that you can guard us again
tonight." The two generals thanked him and left. For the next two or three nights they stood guard and all was
quiet; but the Emperor ate less and less as his illness took a turn for the worse. Not wishing to put the two
generals to any more trouble, he summoned them to the palace with Du Ruhui and Fang Xuanling.
These were the instructions he gave them: "Although we have enjoyed peace for the last two days, we are
unhappy about the night−long ordeals we have imposed on Generals Qin and Yuchi. We therefore wish to
commission two skilled painters to make faithful portraits of the two generals to paste on the doors so that
they may be saved trouble. What do you think?" In obedience to the imperial decree the officials chose two
men who could draw a good likeness, and the two generals wore their armour as before while they were
painted. Then the pictures were stuck on the doors, and there was no trouble that night.
The next two or three days were peaceful too but then the Emperor heard bricks and tiles banging and
crashing once again at the Hou Zai Gate. He summoned his officials at dawn and said, "There has, thank
goodness, been no trouble at the front gates for several days now, but there were noises at the back gates last
night that practically scared me to death." Xu Maogong went forward and submitted this suggestion: "When
there was trouble at the front gates Yuchi Jingde and Qin Shubao protected Your Majesty. Now there is
trouble at the back gates Wei Zheng should be ordered to stand guard."
Taizong approved his suggestion, and ordered Wei Zheng to stand guard at the back gates that night. Wei
Zheng received the edict, and that night he put on his best clothes, belted himself tightly, and took up his vigil
outside the Hou Zai Gate. He was a true hero. He wore
A black band of silk around his forehead,
A brocade gown loosely belted with jade.
Journey to the West
Chapter 10 148
His hood and billowing sleeves caught the frost and dew,
And he looked more ferocious than the ghost−quellers Shenshu and Yul ti.
On his feet he wore black boots for motionless movement;
In his hand he wielded a keen−edged blade with great ferocity.
He looked around with glaring eyes:
What evil spirit would have dared approach?
No devils were seen all night, but although nothing happened at the front or back gates the Emperor's
condition still deteriorated. One day the Empress Dowager issued an edict summoning the officials to discuss
funeral arrangements. Taizong sent for Xu Maogong and gave him orders about affairs of state, instructing
him to look after the heir to the throne in the way that Liu Bei, the ruler of Shu, had instructed Zhuge Liang.
When he had finished speaking he was bathed and put into clean clothes. All he had to do now was to wait for
the end. Then in rushed Wei Zheng, who grabbed hold of his dragon robes and said, "Do not worry, Your
Majesty. I can ensure Your Majesty long life."
"The disease has reached my heart," replied the Emperor, "and my life will end at any moment now, so how
can you save it?"
"Your subject has a letter here," said Wei Zheng, "that I am offering to Your Majesty to take with you to the
underworld and give to Cui Jue, the judge of Fengdu."
"Who is this Cui Jue?" asked the Emperor.
"He was one of the officers of Your Majesty's exalted predecessor. From being magistrate of Cizhou he was
promoted to be vice−president of the Ministry of Rites. When he was alive he and I were close friends. Now
that he is dead he is in charge of the Registers of Birth and Death in the underworld as judge of Fengdu, and
he often comes to see me in my dreams. If you take this letter with you on your journey and give it to him, he
is bound to allow Your Majesty to come back out of consideration for your humble subject. I can guarantee
that Your Majesty's soul will return to the sunlight, and the dragon countenance will certainly return to the
imperial capital." Taizong took the letter and put it in his sleeve, then he shut his eyes in death. The
empresses, consorts and imperial concubines of the three palaces and the six compounds, the palace servants,
the heir to the throne, and the civil and military officials all grieved and dressed in mourning. The imperial
coffin lay in state in the White Tiger Hall.
If you don't know how Taizong came back to life, listen to the explanation in the next chapter.

A hundred years flow by like water;
A lifetime's career is no more than a bubble,
The face that yesterday was the color of peach−blossom
Today is edged with snow.
When the white ants' line of battle collapses, all is illusion;
"Repent, repent," is the cuckoo's urgent call.
He who does good in secret can always prolong his life;
Heaven looks after the one who asks no pity.
Taizong was in a daze as his soul went straight to the Tower of Five Phoenixes, in front of which he saw the
horsemen of the Imperial Guard who invited him out hunting with them. Taizong was glad to go and they
went off into the distance; but after they had been going for some time he found himself walking alone in a
wasteland: the horsemen had all disappeared. Just as he was discovering to his alarm that he could not find his
way a man appeared not far away, shouting.
"Great Tang Emperor, come here, come here." On hearing this Taizong looked up and saw him:
A black silk turban,
A rhinoceros−horn belt.
The black silk turban has tabs blowing in the breeze;
The rhinoceros−horn belt has golden mountings.
In his hands an ivory tablet, glowing auspiciously;
His thin silk gown conceals his divine light.
He wears a pair of boots with whitened soles
As he climbs the clouds and grasps the mist,
Holding to his chest the Registers of Life and Death,
Noting down the quick and the dead.
His tangled hair blows about his ears;
His whiskers dance and fly beside his cheeks.

Chapter 11 150
Once he used to be a Tang minister
But now he judges cases for the King of Hell.
When Taizong went up to him, he fell on his knees beside the path and said, "Your Majesty, please forgive
your subject for his crime of failing to come far enough to meet you."
"Who are you?" asked the Emperor, "and why have you come to meet me?"
"A fortnight ago your humble servant heard the Dragon King of the River Jing bringing a case against Your
Majesty in the Senluo Palace because he was executed despite your promise to save him," replied the other.
"The King of Qinguang of the First Palace sent devil messengers with an urgent summons to Your Majesty to
be present when the case is heard between the Three Orders: the Human Order, the Underworld Order and the
Water Order. When I heard this I came here to meet Your Majesty. I arrived late, so I beg for forgiveness."
"What is your name and position?" asked Taizong.
"When your humble servant was alive I used to serve His Late Majesty. I was magistrate of Cizhou, and later
made vice−president of the Ministry of Rites. My name is Cui Jue. I have now been given office in the
underworld as the judge in charge of cases at Fengdu." Taizong, greatly delighted to learn this, went up to him
and supported him with his imperial hands as he said, "Sir, you have made a long and exhausting journey.
Wei Zheng, our minister, gave us a letter for you; how lucky that we have met." The judge thanked him and
asked where the letter was. Taizong produced it from his sleeve and handed it over to Cui Jue, who received it
with a bow. When he opened it he saw that it read as follows:
Your Excellency, Metropolitan Judge, and Venerable Elder Brother Cui,
Remembering our former friendship; I still see and hear you as if you were alive; but many years have now
flown by since I last received your pure instruction. On feast days I set out some vegetarian dishes as a
sacrifice to you, but I have been unable to divine whether they are enjoyed by you. As I have the good fortune
not to have been abandoned by you and you have appeared to me in dreams, I now know that my great elder
brother has risen high. But, alas, there is a great gap between the worlds of darkness and of light, and we are
unable to meet each other as we are each at different ends of the universe.
As the Cultured Emperor Taizong has recently passed away of a sudden illness it seems likely that his case
will be discussed by the Three Orders, so that he is bound to meet you, elder brother. I beseech you to
remember the friendship of the days when you were alive and give His Majesty such assistance as will enable
him to return to the sunlight. This would be a great favour, and I shall write again to thank you. I cannot go
into all the details of the case here.
Your younger brother kowtows to you.
With affection,
Wei Zheng.
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 151
The judge was very pleased when he had read the letter. "I know about how the official Wei of the personnel
department beheaded the dragon in a dream the other day," he said, "and this news filled me with great
admiration. He has always looked after my sons and grandsons, and now that I have a letter from him, Your
Majesty need have no worries. Your humble servant can undertake to escort Your Majesty back to the light,
where you will once more ascend the throne." Taizong thanked him.
As they were talking a pair of servant boys in black appeared, carrying banners and a precious canopy. "An
invitation from King Yama," they shouted. Taizong and Judge Cui went along with them. A city wall
appeared in front of them, and above its gates hung a large tablet on which was written DEVIL GATE OF
THE WORLD OF DARKNESS in huge letters of gold. The two lictors waved their banners and led Taizong
into the city and along its streets. Beside the road he saw his father and predecessor Li Yuan, as well as his
dead brothers Jaincheng and Yuanji, who went up to him and said, "Shimin's here, Shimin's here," using his
personal name. They grabbed and hit him, demanding their lives back; and as Taizong could not avoid them
they held him fast until Judge Cui ordered a blue−faced devil with terrible fangs to drive them away. Only
then was Taizong able to escape from their clutches. After another mile or so he saw a green−tiled tower
rising majestically before him.
A myriad coloured veils of haze drifting about it,
A thousand wisps of red mist dimly appearing.
The flying eaves had monsters at their ends,
The matching tiles of the five roofs were gleaming bright.
Rows of golden studs were driven into the doors,
A length of whitest jade was placed across each threshold.
When the windows faced the light they glowed like the dawn;
Red lightning flashed from the lattice and the blinds.
The tower soared into the azure sky
While porticos led to sumptuous courtyards.
Incense from braziers shaped like beasts perfumed the royal robes;
The light from lanterns of purple gauze was thrown on palace fans.
To the left a row of ferocious bull−headed demons;
To the right were terrible horse−faced devils.
Those who escorted the spirits of the dead had golden tablets;
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 152
Those who summoned souls wore white sackcloth.
This place was called the assembly of the underworld,
The Palace of Yama, King of Hell.
As Taizong gazed at it from the outside, jade ornaments could be heard tinkling as they swung from the belts
of officials, and rare perfumes could be smelt. In front were two pairs of attendants holding lanterns, and
behind them the ten generations of kings of the underworld came down the steps. The ten kings were the King
of Qinguang, the King of Chujiang, King Songdi, King Wuguan, King Yama, King Impartial, King of Mount
Tai, the Metropolitan King, the King of Biancheng, and the King of the Ever−turning Wheel. They came out
of the Senluo Palace and bowed to Taizong in greeting. Taizong felt too humble to go forward.
"Your Majesty is a monarch in the world of light, but we are only kings in the world of darkness. It is
therefore only right that we should do this, so why this excessive modesty?"
"We have offended against Your Majesties," replied Taizong, "so how can we venture to talk in terms of light
and darkness, or men and ghosts?" After much yielding Taizong went into the Senluo Palace, and when they
had finished bowing to each other they sat down as hosts and guest.
A moment later the King of Qinguang clasped his hands together and said, "Why is it that the ghost dragon of
the River Jing has brought a case against Your Majesty, saying that he was executed despite your promise to
save him?"
"I had a dream that an old dragon came to ask me to save him," replied Taizong, "and I did in fact promise
that he would come to no harm; but as it turned out his crime was a capital one, for which he was due to be
beheaded by the minister in the personnel department, Wei Zheng. We summoned Wei Zheng to come and
play chess in the palace, and I never knew that he had beheaded the dragon in a dream. This happened because
that officer can come and go miraculously, and also because the dragon king had committed a crime for which
he deserved to die. We were in no way to blame for his death."
When the Ten Kings heard his statement they bowed and replied, "Even before that dragon was born it was
written in the registers of the Southern Pole Star that he was destined to die at the hands of a personnel
minister, as we have long been aware. But because he has been arguing about the matter we had to send for
Your Majesty. When the case has been argued between the three orders we shall send him to the Revolving
Prayer−wheel for reincarnation. We hope that Your Majesty will forgive us for forcing you to attend." Then
they ordered the judge in charge of the Registers of Birth and Death to fetch them at once to see how long His
Majesty was due to live. Judge Cui hurried to his office and took down the general register of the lengths of
the reigns Heaven had allowed to the kings of all the countries of the earth. As he was looking through it he
saw to his horror that Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang in the Southern Jambu Continent was due to die in
year 13 of his reign. He hurriedly seized a large brush soaked in ink, changed 13 into 33, then he handed the
register up. The Ten Kings started at the beginning and read it through until they saw that Taizong was due to
reign for thirty−three years.
"How long has Your Majesty been on the throne?" asked the shocked kings of hell.
"It is now thirteen years since my accession," Taizong replied.
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 153
"Then there is no need for Your Majesty to worry," said King Yama. "You have twenty years of life ahead of
you. Now that you have answered these charges satisfactorily, will you please return to the World of Light."
On hearing this Taizong bowed and thanked the Ten Kings, who then ordered judge Cui and marshal Zhu to
return Taizong his soul. As he was leaving the Senluo Palace Taizong raised his hand in salutation and asked
the Ten Kings about the prospects for all the members of his family in his palace.
"Good," they replied, "except that Your Majesty's younger sister does not seem to be going to live much
longer." Taizong bowed once more to express his thanks.
"When we return to the daylight we shall have nothing with which to show our gratitude except for fruit and
melons."
"We have gourds, Eastern melons and Western melons, or water−melons, here, but no pumpkins, no Southern
melons," said the Ten Kings.
"When we return to the world of the living we shall send some," replied Taizong, and with that they raised
their clasped hands to each other, bowed, and parted.
The marshal, with a soul−guiding flag in his hand, led the way, and Judge Cui followed with Taizong as they
left the office of darkness. Taizong looked up and saw that they were not going the same way as they had
come.
"Have we taken the wrong road?" he asked the judge, who replied, "No. In the underworld you can only go;
you can never come back. We are now taking Your Majesty out through the Revolving Prayer−wheel; thus
you will be able to tour the underworld on your way back to life." Taizong had no choice but to follow them
as they led the way.
After a mile or two he saw a high mountain wrapped in dark clouds down to its foot, while a black mist
blotted out the sky.
"What's that mountain over there, Mr. Cui?" he asked; and the judge replied, "That is the Dark Mountain of
the underworld."
"However shall we cross it?" Taizong asked in terror.
"Have no fears, Your Majesty; your subjects will lead the way," answered the judge. Taizong followed them
shivering and trembling, and when they had climbed the mountain he looked around him. He saw that it was
Jagged,
Precipitous,
High as the Sichuan ranges,
Lofty as Lushan.
It is not a famous peak of the world of light,
But a crag of the underworld.

Ogres hidden in the clumps of thorns,
Evil monsters lurk behind the cliffs.
Your ears hear no calls of animals or birds,
The eyes can only see fiends.
A dark wind howls,
As black fog spreads.
The dark wind that howls
Is the smoke breathed from the mouths of magic soldiers;
The spreading black fog
Is the vapour belched out by hidden trolls.
Wherever you look the prospect is appalling;
All you can see to left or right is unbridled evil.
To be sure, there are hills,
Peaks,
Ranges,
Caves,
And gullies.
But no grass grows on the hills,
There is no sky for the peaks to touch.
No travelers cross the ranges,
The caves hold no clouds,
No water runs in the gullies.
Before the cliffs there are only goblins,
Below the ranges are trolls.
Savage ghosts shelter in the caves,
Evil spirits hide in the gullies.

All around the mountain
Ox−headed and horse−faced demons howl and roar;
Half hidden from view,
Hungry ghosts and desperate spirits sob to each other.
The judge who claims men's lives
Cannot wait to deliver the letter;
The marshal who chases souls,
Shouts and roars as he hastens along with his documents.
The swift−footed ones
Swirl along like a tornado;
The catchers of souls
Stand as thick as clouds.
Thanks entirely to the protection of the judge, Taizong crossed the Dark Mountain.
As they continued on their way they went past very many courts, and from each of them piteous sounds
assailed his ear, while the evil ghouls there struck terror into his heart.
"What place is this?" asked Taizong.
"It is the eighteen layers of hell that lie behind the Dark Mountain," the judge replied.
"What are the eighteen layers?" asked Taizong.
"Listen and I will tell you," the judge replied.
"The Hanging−by−the−Sinews Hell, the Hell of Injustice, and the Hell of the Pit of Fire.
Loneliness and desolation,
Misery and suffering.
All those here committed the thousand lower sins,
And were sent here for punishment after death.

The Fengdu Hell, the Tongue−extraction Hell, the Flaying Hell:
Howling and wailing,
Terrible anguish.
They offended against Heaven by not being loyal or filial;
They have Buddha−mouths but snake hearts, so fell down here.
The Grinding Hell, the Pounding Hell, the Hell of Drawing and Quartering.
Skin and flesh ripped and torn,
Lips rubbed away till the teeth show.
In the blindness of their hearts they did evil things;
For all their fine words they harmed others in secret.
The Ice Hell, the Skin−shedding Hell, the Disemboweling Hell.
Filthy faces and matted hair,
Frowning foreheads and sad eyes.
They all used false measures to cheat the foolish,
Thus piling up disasters for themselves.
The Oil−cauldron Hell, the Hell of Blackness, the Hell of the Mountain of Knives.
Shivering and trembling,
In terrible agony;
Because they used violence against the good
They cower and hunch their shoulders in their suffering.
The Hell of the Pool of Blood, the Avichi Hell, the Hell of the Steelyard Beam,
Where skin is pulled away from the bone,
Arms are broken and tendons cut.
Because they killed for gain,
Butchering living creatures,
They fell into these torments that will not end in a thousand years;
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 157
They will always lie here, never to escape.
Every one of them is tightly bound,
Knotted and roped.
Red−faced demons,
And black−faced demons,
Are sent with their long halberds and short swords.
Ox−headed fiends.
And horse−faced fiends,
With iron clubs and brazen hammers,
Beat them till their wincing faces flow with blood,
As they call on Heaven and Earth and get no answer.
Let no man alive have any illusions:
The devils carry out their orders and release nobody.
Good and evil will always be rewarded:
It is only a question of time."
Before they had gone much further a group of devil soldiers holding banners knelt down beside the road and
said, "The Commissioners of the Bridges welcome you." The Judge shouted to them that they were to rise and
led Taizong across a golden bridge. Taizong saw that there was a silver bridge beside it over which some
loyal, filial, worthy, just, and upright people were passing, led by banners. There was a third bridge on the
other side with an icy wind roaring across it and waves of blood boiling below amid unbroken howls and
wails.
"What is that bridge called?" Taizong asked, and the Judge replied, "Your Majesty, that is called the Bridge of
Punishment, and you must tell people about it when you return to the world of the living. Below the bridge
there are
A narrow, precipitous path
Over a mighty, rushing river.
It is like a strip of cloth across the Yangtse,
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 158
Or a fiery pit rising up to Heaven.
The icy vapours freeze one to the bone;
Nauseating stenches assail the nostrils.
There is no boat to ferry you
Across the crashing waves.
All who appear are sinful ghosts
With bare feet and matted hair.
The bridge is many miles long
And only three fingers wide;
The drop is a hundred feet,
The waters are infinitely deeper.
Above there are no railings for support,
While trolls snatch their victims from below.
In cangues and bonds
They are driven along the dangerous path by the River of Punishment.
See the ferocity of the divine generals by the bridge;
Watch how the ghosts of the wicked suffer in the river.
On the branching trees
Hang silken clothes in blue, red, yellow and purple;
In front of the precipice
Squat lewd and shameless women who swore at their parents−in−law.
Copper snakes and iron dogs feast on them at will,
As they constantly fall in the river, never to escape.
There is a poem that goes:
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 159
As ghosts wail and spirits howl
The waves of blood tower high.
Countless ghouls with heads of bulls and horses
Guard the bridge with great ferocity.
The commissioners of the bridges had gone away while he was speaking. Taizong's heart was once more
filled with horror, and he nodded his head and sighed silently in his distress, then followed the judge and the
Marshal. Before long they crossed the evil River of Punishment and passed the terrors of the Bowl of Blood.
Then they came to the City of the Unjustly Slain. Amid the hubbub, shouts of "Li Shimin's here, Li Shimin's
here," could be made out, to the terror of Taizong. He saw that his way was blocked by a crowd of maimed
and headless spectres.
"Give us back our lives," they were all shouting, "give us back our lives." The panic−stricken Taizong tried to
hide, yelling, "Help, Judge Cui, help, help."
"Your Majesty," the judge replied, "these are the ghosts of the kings and chieftains of the sixty−four groups of
rebels and the seventy−two troops of bandits. They were all killed unjustly, and nobody has given them a
home or looked after them. They cannot get themselves reborn as they have no money for the journey, so they
are all uncared−for cold and hungry ghosts. If Your Majesty is able to give them some money I can save you."
"I came here empty−handed," Taizong replied, "so where could I possibly get any money?"
"Your Majesty," the judge replied, "there is a man in the world of light who deposited a certain amount of
money in the underworld. If Your Majesty is prepared to sign an I.O.U., I will endorse it, and we can borrow
his store of money to distribute among these hungry ghosts; then we will be able to continue on our way,"
"Who is this man?" asked Taizong.
"He is a man of Kaifeng in Henan," the judge replied, "and his name is Xiang Liang. He has thirteen hoards of
gold and silver down here, and if Your Majesty borrows them, all you have to do is repay them when you
return to the world of light." Taizong was very pleased, and only too eager to borrow one. He signed an I.O.U.
at once and gave it to the judge, then borrowed a store, which he gave to the marshal to hand out.
"You are to share out this gold and silver and let your Lord of the Great Tang past," said the judge. "As it is
too early in his life, I am under orders from the ten kings to return his soul and tell him to hold a Great Mass
when he is back in the world of light to enable all of you to be reborn, so don't be making any more trouble."
When the ghosts heard what he had to say and were given the gold and silver they all withdrew, murmuring
their obedient assent. The judge then told the marshal to wave his soul−leading flag, and Taizong was taken
out of the City of the Unjustly Slain and floated along the highway to the daylight.
After they had been going for a long time they reached the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being. Some people
were soaring in the clouds, wearing cloaks of rosy mist. Others were being given office with golden insignia
to hang from their waists. Monks and nuns, clergy and lay people, beasts of the field and birds of the air,
ghosts and devils−−all were pouring under the wheel and each was going along his allotted path.
"What's all this about?" asked the Tang Emperor.
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 160
"Your Majesty is a man of deep understanding," the judge replied. "You must be sure to remember all this and
tell the living about it. It is called the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being. Those who have done good deeds rise
on the Path of the Immortals; those who have been loyal are reborn on the Path of Honour; those who have
done their duty to their parents lead their next life on the Path of Happiness; those who have been just return
to life on the Path of Man; those who have accumulated merit are reborn on the Path of Wealth; and the
evildoers fall down into the Path of Devils." On hearing this the Tang Emperor nodded and said with a sigh:
"Excellent, truly excellent,
The virtuous come to no harm.
The good heart is always mindful,
The way of goodness always lies open.
"Do not allow evil thoughts to arise;
Thus you will avoid all trouble.
Say not that there is no retribution;
Whether you become a god or a ghost is all determined.
The judge took Taizong straight to the Gate of Rebirth on the Path of Honour, bowed to him and said, "Your
Majesty, this is the way out, where I shall have to take my leave and go back. Marshal Zhu will escort you for
the next stage of your journey."
"I have made you come an awfully long way, sir," said the Tang Emperor as he thanked him.
"When Your Majesty returns to the world of the living you absolutely must hold a Great Mass to enable those
forlorn ghosts to be reborn," replied the judge. "Don't on any account forget, as there can only be peace on
Earth if there are no vengeance−seeking ghosts in the underworld. Every single wrong will have to be
corrected. Teach all people to be good, and then you will be able to assure the continuity of your line and the
eternal security of your empire."
The Tang Emperor agreed to each of his proposals and took leave of him, then went through the gates with
Marshal Zhu. Seeing a fine horse standing ready and saddled inside the gates, the marshal asked Taizong to
mount it with the help of his assistants. The horse was as swift as an arrow, and it was soon at the banks of the
River Wei, where a pair of golden carp could be seen sporting in the water. Taizong, captivated at the sight,
pulled in his horse's reins and gazed at them.
"Your Majesty," the marshal said, "please keep moving. We have to enter the city early." But all the Tang
Emperor wanted to do was to look. As he would not move on the marshal grabbed him by the feet and
shouted, "Get moving. What are you waiting for?" as he pushed him off his horse and into the River Wei with
a splash. Taizong was now free of the underworld and back in the world of the living.
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 161
The civil and military officials of the Tang court, Xu Maogong, Qin Shubao, Yuchi Jingde, Duan Zhixian, Ma
Sanbao, Cheng Yaojin, Gao Shilian, Li Shiji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xiao Yu, Fu Yi, Zhang Daoyuan,
Zhang Shiheng, Wang Gui and the others, as well as the empresses, imperial consorts and concubines, and
pages were all in the White Tiger Hall. They were discussing whether to issue an edict of mourning to inform
the world so that the heir could be put on the throne.
Wei Zheng was saying, "Gentlemen, stop this discussion. We must not do that. If the country is alarmed,
anything might happen. If we wait for another day our master is bound to come back to life." Xu Jingzong
stepped forward from the lower ranks and protested, "Minister Wei is talking nonsense. As the old saying
goes, 'split water can't be picked up and the dead can't come back to life.' What business have you to be
spreading confusion with these groundless claims?"
"Mr. Xu," Wei Zheng replied, "I can say truthfully that I have been given instruction in the magic arts since
childhood and my predictions are extremely accurate. I can assure you that I have saved His Majesty from
death."
As they were arguing they heard loud shouts of "You're drowning me, you're drowning me," coming from the
coffin. The civil officials and the generals were struck with terror; the empresses and consorts shivered. Every
one of them had
A face as yellow as a mulberry−leaf after autumn,
A waist as weak as a willow sapling before spring.
The heir went weak at the knees,
As he stood in full mourning, unable to hold up his staff;
The attendants' souls flew away:
How would it do for them to be wearing mourning hats and clothes?
The consorts and concubines collapsed,
The palace beauties had to lie down.
When the consorts and concubines collapsed,
It was like a gale blowing down withered lotuses.
When the palace beauties lay down
It was like a rainstorm beating young lotuses down.
All the ministers were terrified
And their limbs went numb;
They shivered and shook,
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 162
Struck dumb and stupid.
The White Tiger Hall was like a bridge collapsing,
And the confusion round the coffin
Was like a temple falling down.
All the palace women fled, as not one of them dared to approach the imperial coffin. Luckily the upright Xu
Maogong, the trusty Wei Zheng, the brave Qin Shubao, and the ferocious Yuchi Jingde went forward to put
their hands on the coffin and shouted, "What is it that worries Your Majesty and makes you speak to us? Tell
us, and do not haunt us and scare the royal family."
"His Majesty is not haunting us," Wei Zheng said. "His Majesty has come back to life. Bring tools at once."
They opened the coffin and found Taizong sitting up inside and still shouting, "You're drowning me. Save me,
someone." Xu Maogong and the others helped him to his feet and said, "There is nothing to fear as you come
round, Your Majesty. We are all here to protect you." The Tang Emperor then opened his eyes and said, "We
have been having an awful time: after escaping from the evil demons of the underworld, we were drowned."
"Relax, Your Majesty, there is nothing to fear. How could you have drowned?" the ministers said. "We were
riding along the banks of the River Wei and watching to fishes playing when that deceitful Marshal Zhu
pushed us off the horse and made us fall into the river, where we all but drowned."
"Your Majesty still has something of the ghost about you," said Wei Zheng, and he ordered the Imperial
Medical Academy to send medicinal potions to settle the spirit and calm the soul at once; he also sent for
some thin gruel. After one or two doses of the medicine the Emperor returned to normal and regained full
consciousness. The Tang Emperor had been dead for three days and nights before returning to rule the world
of the living once more. There is a poem to prove it:
Since ancient times there have been changes of power;
Dynasties have always waxed and waned.
What deed of the kings of old could compare
With the Emperor of Tang returning to life?
As it was evening by then the ministers asked the Emperor to go to bed, and they all dispersed.
The next day they all took off their mourning garments and put colorful clothes back on. Wearing red robes
and black hats, and with their golden seals of office hanging from purple ribbons at their waists, they stood
outside the gates of the court awaiting the summons. As for Taizong, after taking the medicine to settle his
spirit and calm his soul and drinking some thin gruel he was helped to his bedroom by his ministers. He slept
soundly all night, building up his energies, and at dawn he rose. See how he was arrayed as he summoned up
his authority:
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 163
On his head a hat that thrust into the sky;
On his body a dark yellow robe
Girt with a belt of Lantian jade;
On his feet a pair of Shoes of Success.
The dignity of his bearing
Surpasses all others at court.
His awesome majesty
Is today restored.
What a peaceful and wise Great Tang Emperor,
The king named Li who can die and rise again.
The Tang Emperor entered the throne hall, and when the two groups of civil and military officials had
finished acclaiming him they divided into sections according to their ranks. When they heard the decree, "Let
all those with business step forward from their sections and submit memorials, and let those with no business
retire," Xu Maogong, Wei Zheng, Wang Gui, Du Ruhui, Fang Xuanling, Yuan Tiangang, Li Chunfeng, Xu
Jingzong and others stepped forward on the Eastern side; and on the Western side Yin Kaishan, Liu Hongji,
Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Cheng Yaojin, Qin Shubao, Yuchi Jingde, Xue Rengui and others stepped forward
also.
They advanced together, bowed low before the white jade steps, and asked in a memorial, "Why did it take
Your Majesty so long to awake from your dream the other day?"
To this Taizong replied, "The other day we took Wei Zheng's letter and felt our soul leaving the palace. The
horsemen of the Imperial Guard asked us to go hunting with them, and as we were going along the men and
their horses all vanished. His Late Majesty and our dead brothers appeared and started to shout at us in a
quarrelsome way. Things were getting very awkward when we saw a man in a black hat and gown who turned
out to be the judge Cui Jue. When he had shouted at my dead brothers and driven them away we gave him
Wei Zheng's letter. As he was reading it some servants in black holding banners led us in and took us to the
Senluo Palace, where the Ten Kings of Hell were all sitting. They said that the dragon of the River Jing had
falsely accused us of deliberately killing him after we had promised to save him, so we gave them a full
account of what we told you about before. They said that the case had now been settled between the three
orders, and ordered that the Registers of Birth and Death be brought at once so that they could see how long
we were due to live. Judge Cui handed up the register, and they saw in it that we were due to reign for
thirty−three years, which meant that we had another twenty years of life in front of us. They told Marshal Zhu
and Judge Cui to escort us back. We took our leave of the Ten Kings and promised to send them some
pumpkins and fruit as a mark of our thanks. After leaving the Senluo Palace we saw in the underworld how
the disloyal, the unfilial, those who do not observe the rules of propriety, wasters of foodgrains, bullies,
cheats, those who use false measures, adulterers, robbers, hypocrites, deceivers, debauchees, swindlers and the
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 164
like undergo the agonies of being ground, burnt, pounded and sliced, and suffer the torments of being fried,
boiled, hung in mid−air, and skinned. There were tens of thousands of them, far more than our eyes could take
in. Then we went through the City of the Unjustly Slain where there were countless ghosts of the wrongly
killed, and all of them, the chieftains of the sixty−four groups of rebels and the spirits of the seventy−two
bands of rebels, blocking our way. Luckily Judge Cui acted as our guarantor and lent us one of the hoards of
gold and silver of a Mr. Xiang of Henan, with which we were able to buy them off and continue on our way.
Judge Cui told us that when we returned to the world of the living we had an inescapable obligation to hold a
Great Mass to enable all those forlorn ghosts to be reborn, and with these instructions he took his leave. When
I came out under the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being Marshal Zhu invited us to mount a horse. This horse
seemed to fly to the banks of the River Wei, where I saw a pair of fish sporting in the water. Just as we were
enjoying this sight the marshal grabbed our legs and tipped us into the water, and with that we returned to
life."
When the ministers had heard this they all congratulated him and they compiled a record of it; and all the
prefectures and counties of the empire sent in memorials of felicitation.
Taizong issued a decree of amnesty for all the convicted criminals in the empire and ordered inquiries into the
cases of all those held in jail on serious charges. The inspectors submitted to the throne the names of more
than four hundred criminals who had been sentenced by the Ministry of Punishments to beheading or
strangulation, and Taizong gave them a stay of execution, allowing them to go home to see their families and
give their property to their relations; on the same day the following year they were to report to the authorities
for their sentences to be carried out. The criminals thanked him for his mercy and withdrew. He also issued a
notice about charity for orphans and released three thousand women of all ages from the palace to be married
to members of the army. From then on all was well within and without the palace. There is a poem to prove it:
Vast is the mercy of the great Tang Emperor;
He surpasses Yao and Shun in making the people prosper.
Four hundred condemned men all left their prisons,
Three thousand mistreated women were released from the palace.
All the officials of the empire proclaim the monarch's long life;
The ministers at court congratulate the Great Dragon.
Heaven responds to the thoughts of the good heart,
Its blessing will protect his seventeen successors.
When he had released the women from the palace and let the condemned men out of prison he issued a notice
that was posted throughout the empire. It read:
"Great are Heaven and Earth;
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 165
Sun and Moon shine clearly.
Although the universe is vast,
Earth and sky have no room for evil plots.
If you use your wits and skill to cheat people,
You will get retribution in this life;
If you are good at giving and ask for little,
You are sure to find a reward before your future life.
A thousand cunning plans
Cannot compare with living according to one's lot;
Ten thousand kinds of robbers
Are no match for those who live frugally and accept their fate.
If you are good and merciful in thought and deed,
What need is there to bother to read the scriptures?
If your mind is full of malice towards others,
To read the whole of the Buddha's canon would be a waste of time."
From then on everyone in the country did good deeds. Another notice was issued calling for a worthy man to
take pumpkins to the underworld, and at the same time Yuchi Jingde, the Duke of E, was sent to Kaifeng in
Henan to visit Xiang Liang and pay him back a hoard of jewels and a hoard of gold and silver. Some days
after the notice had been issued a worthy man called Liu Quan from Junzhou came forward to deliver the
pumpkins. He came from a family worth ten thousand strings of cash. When his wife Li Cuilian had taken a
gold pin from her hair to give as an offering to a monk at the gate, Liu Quan had cursed her for being a loose
wife who would not stay in the women's quarters. Li Cuilian, bitterly resenting this, had hanged herself,
leaving a little boy and girl who had been crying night and day ever since. Liu Quan, unable to bear it any
longer, wanted only to end his own life and abandon his family and his children. For this reason he had
volunteered to deliver the pumpkins in death and came to the Tang Emperor with the imperial notice in his
hand. The Emperor ordered him to go to the Golden Pavilion, where he was to put a pair of pumpkins on his
head and some gold in his sleeve and drink poison.
Journey to the West
Chapter 11 166
Liu Quan drank the poison and died. In an instant his soul appeared at the Devil Gate with the pumpkins on
his head. The demon officer at the gate asked, "Who are you, and how did you come here?"
"I have come on the orders of Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang to present some pumpkins to the Ten Kings
of Hell." The officer was only too pleased to let him in, and he went straight to the Senluo Palace, and when
he was given audience with the Kings of Hell he presented the pumpkins to them and said, "I have brought
these pumpkins a great distance in obedience to the decree of the Tang Emperor, who wishes to thank Your
Majesties for their great mercy to him."
"How splendid of the Tang Emperor to be as good as his word," exclaimed the ten delighted kings as they
accepted the pumpkins. Then they asked him what he was called and where he was from.
"I am a commoner of the city of Junzhou," he replied, "and my name is Liu Quan. As my wife Miss Li hanged
herself and left a boy and a girl with nobody to look after them I wanted to abandon my family and children
by giving my life for my country, so I brought this offering of pumpkins on behalf of my sovereign, who
wanted to thank Your Majesties for your great mercy." On hearing this the Ten Kings ordered a search for Liu
Quan's wife, Miss Li. The devil messengers soon brought her to the Senluo Palace, outside which Liu Quan
was reunited with her. They thanked the Ten Kings for their kindness and told them about the harsh words
that had been spoken. On consulting the Registers of Birth and Death, the kings found that they were fated to
become Immortals, so they ordered demon officers to take them back at once. The demon officers, however,
asked in a report, "As Li Cuilian has been dead for some time her body has perished, so what is her soul to be
attached to?"
"Li Yuying, the sister of the Tang Emperor, is due to die a sudden death today," said the Kings of Hell, "so we
can borrow her body to put Li Cuilian's soul back into." On receiving this order the demon officers took Liu
Quan and his wife out of the underworld to be brought back to life. If you don't know how they returned to
life, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 12
The Tang Emperor Keeps Faith and Holds a Great Mass
Guanyin Appears to the Reincarnated Golden Cicada
When the devil officers left the underworld with Liu Quan and his wife, a dark and whirling wind blew them
straight to the great capital Chang'an, where Liu Quan's soul was sent to the Golden Pavilion and Li Cuilian's
to an inner courtyard of the palace, where Princess Yuying could be seen walking slowing beside some moss
under the shade of some blossoming trees. Suddenly the devil officers struck her full in the chest and knocked
her over; they snatched the soul from her living body and put Li Cuilian's soul into the body in its place. With
that they returned to the underworld.
When the palace serving−women saw her drop dead they rushed to the throne hall to report to the three
empresses that Her Royal Highness the Princess had dropped dead. The shocked empresses passed the news
on to Taizong who sighed and said, "We can well believe it. When we asked the Ten Lords of Hell if young
and old in our palace would all be well, they replied that they would all be well except that our younger sister
was going to die suddenly. How true that was."
He and everyone else in the palace went with great sorrow to look at her lying under the trees, only to see that
she was breathing very lightly.
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 167
"Don't wail," the Tang Emperor said, "don't wail; it might alarm her." Then he raised her head with his own
hand and said, "Wake up, sister, wake up."
All of a sudden the princess sat up and called out, "Don't go so fast, husband. Wait for me."
"Sister, we're waiting for you here," said the Emperor.
The princess lifted her head, opened her eyes, and looked at him. "Who are you?" she asked. "How dare you
put your hands on us?"
"It's your august brother, royal sister," replied Taizong.
"I've got nothing to do with august brothers and royal sisters," said the princess. "My maiden name is Li, and
my full name is Li Cuilian. My husband is Liu Quan, and we both come from Junzhou. When I gave a gold
hairpin to a monk at the gate three months ago my husband said harsh words to me about leaving the women's
quarters and not behaving as a good wife should. It made me so angry and upset that I hanged myself from a
beam with a white silk sash, leaving a boy and a girl who cried all night and all day. As my husband was
commissioned by the Tang Emperor to go to he underworld to deliver some pumpkins, the Kings of Hell took
pity on us and let the two of us come back to life. He went ahead, but I lagged behind. When I tried to catch
him up I tripped. You are all quite shameless to be mauling me like this. I don't even know your names."
"We think that Her Royal Highness is delirious after passing out when she fell," said Taizong to the palace
women. He sent an order to the Medical Academy for some medicinal potions, and helped Yuying into the
palace.
When the Tang Emperor was back in his throne−hall, one of his aides came rushing in to report, "Your
Majesty, Liu Quan, the man who delivered the pumpkins, is awaiting your summons outside the palace gates."
The startled Taizong immediately sent for Liu Quan, who prostrated himself before the vermilion steps of the
throne.
"What happened when you presented the pumpkins?" asked the Tang Emperor.
"Your subject went straight to the Devil Gate with the pumpkins on my head. I was taken to the Senluo Palace
where I saw the Ten Kings of Hell, to whom I presented the pumpkins, explaining how very grateful my
emperor was. The Kings of Hell were very pleased. They bowed in Your Majesty's honour and said, 'How
splendid of the Tang Emperor to be as good as his word.'"
"What did you see in the underworld?" asked the Emperor.
"I did not go very far there so I did not see much. But when the kings asked me where I was from and what I
was called, I told them all about how I had volunteered to leave my family and my children to deliver the
pumpkins because my wife had hanged herself. They immediately ordered demon officers to bring my wife,
and we were reunited outside the Senluo Palace. Meanwhile they inspected the Registers of Births and Deaths
and saw that my wife and I were both due to become Immortals, so they sent devil officers to bring us back. I
went ahead with my wife following behind, and although I was fortunate enough to come back to life, I don't
know where her soul has been put."
"What did the Kings of Hell say to you about your wife?" asked the astonished Emperor.
"They didn't say anything," replied Liu Quan, "but I heard a demon officer say, 'As Li Cuilian has been dead
for some time her body has decomposed.' To this the Kings of Hell said, 'Li Yuying of the Tang house is due
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 168
to die today, so we can borrow her body to put Li Cuilian's soul back into.' As I don't know where this Tang
house is or where she lives, I haven't been able to go and look for her yet."
The Tang Emperor, who was now very pleased, said to his officials, "When we were leaving the Kings of
Hell, we asked them about our family. They said all its members would be well except for my sister. She
collapsed and died under the shade of some blossoming trees, and when we hurried over to support her she
came to, shouting 'Don't go so fast, husband. Wait for me.' We thought at the time that she was just talking
deliriously after passing out, but when we asked her to tell us more her story tallied precisely with Liu
Quan's."
"If Her Royal Highness died suddenly and came to shortly afterwards talking like this, then it means that Liu
Quan's wife must have borrowed her body to come back to life," said Wei Zheng. "Things like this do happen.
The princess should be asked to come out so that we can hear what she says."
"We have just ordered the Imperial Medical Academy to send some medicine, so we don't know whether it
will be possible," said the Tang Emperor, who then sent a consort into the palace to ask her to come out. The
princess, meanwhile, was shouting wildly inside the palace, "I'm taking none of your medicine. This isn't my
home. My home is a simple tiled house, not like this jaundiced, yellow place with its flashy doors. Let me out,
let me out."
Four of five women officials and two or three eunuchs appeared while she was shouting and helped her go
straight to the throne hall, where the Tang Emperor asked, "Would you recognize your husband if you saw
him?"
"What a thing to ask! We've been married since we were children, and I've given him a son and a daughter, so
of course I'd recognize him." The Emperor told his attendants to help her down and she went down from the
throne hall. As soon as she saw Liu Quan in front of the white jade steps she seized hold of him.
"Husband!" she exclaimed, "where did you go? Why didn't you wait for me? I tripped over, and all these
shameless people surrounded me and shouted at me. Wasn't that shocking?" Although Liu Quan could hear
that it was his wife talking, she looked like somebody else, so he did not dare to recognize her as his wife.
"Indeed," said the Emperor,
"Sometimes mountains collapse and the earth yawns open,
But few men will shorten their lives to die for another."
As he was a good and wise monarch he gave all of the princess' dressing−cases, clothes and jewelry to Liu
Quan as if they were a dowry, presented him with an edict freeing him from labor service for life, and told
him to take the princess home with him. Husband and wife thanked him before the steps and returned home
very happily. There is a poem to prove it:
Life and death are pre−ordained;
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 169
Some have many years, others few.
When Liu Quan came back to the light after taking the pumpkins,
Li Cuilian returned to life in a borrowed body.
After leaving the Emperor the pair went straight back to the city of Junzhou, where they found that their
household and their children were all well. There is no need to go into how the two of them publicized their
virtue rewarded.
The story turns to Lord Yuchi, who went to Kaifeng in Henan with a hoard of gold and silver for Xiang Liang,
who made a living by selling water and dealing in black pots and earthenware vessels with his wife, whose
maiden name was Zhang, at the gate of their house. When they made some money they were content to keep
enough for their daily expenses, giving the rest as alms to monks or using it to buy paper ingots of gold and
silver, which they assigned to various hoards in the underworld and burnt. That was why they were now to be
so well rewarded. Although he was only a pious pauper in this world, he owned mountains of jade and gold in
the other one. When Lord Yuchi brought them the gold and silver, Mr. and Mrs. Xiang were terrified out of
their wits. Apart from his lordship there were also officials from the local government office, and horses and
carriages were packed tight outside their humble cottage. The two of them fell to their knees dumbfounded
and began to kowtow.
"Please rise," said Lord Yuchi. "Although I am merely an imperial commissioner, I bring gold and silver from
His Majesty to return to you." Shivering and shaking Xiang Liang replied, "I've lent out no silver or gold, so
how could I dare to accept this mysterious wealth?"
"I know that your are a poor man," said Lord Yuchi, "but you have given monks everything they need and
bought paper ingots of gold and silver which you have assigned to the underworld and burnt, thus
accumulating large sums of money down there. When His Majesty the Emperor Taizong was dead for three
days before returning to life he borrowed one of your hoards of gold and silver down there, which he is now
repaying to you in full. Please check it through so that I can go back and report that I have carried out my
instructions." Xiang Liang and his wife just went on bowing to Heaven and refused to take the gold and silver.
"If humble folk like ourselves took all this gold and silver it'd soon be the death of us. Although we have
burned some paper and assigned it to various stores, it was a secret. Anyhow, what proof is there that His
Majesty−−may he live for ten thousand years−−borrowed gold and silver down there? We refuse to accept it."
"The Emperor said that Judge Cui was his guarantor when he borrowed your money, and this can be verified,
so please accept it," replied Lord Yuchi.
"I would sooner die than do so," said Xiang Liang.
Seeing how earnestly he refused Lord Yuchi had to send a man back with a detailed report to the throne. On
reading this report that Xiang Liang had refused to accept the gold and silver, Taizong said, "He really is a
pious old fellow." He sent orders to Yuchi Jingde that he was to build a temple in his name, erect a shrine to
him, and invite monks to do good deeds on his behalf: this would be as good as paying him back the gold and
silver. On the day this decree reached him Yuchi Jingde turned towards the palace to thank the Emperor, and
read it aloud for all to hear. Then he bought fifty mu of land at a place inside the city that would not be in the
way from either the civil or the military point of view, and here work was begun on a monastery to be called
The Imperially Founded Xiang Quo Monastery. To its left was erected a shrine to Mr. and Mrs. Xiang with an
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 170
inscribed tablet that read "Built under the supervision of Lord Yuchi." This is the present Great Xiang Guo
Monastery.
When he was informed that work had been completed Taizong was very pleased, and assembling the
multitude of officials he issued a notice summoning monks to come and hold a Great Mass for the rebirth of
those lonely souls in the underworld. As the notice traveled throughout the empire the local officials
everywhere recommended holy and venerable monks to go to Chang'an for the service. By the end of the
month many monks had arrived in Chang'an from all over the empire. The Emperor issued a decree ordering
Fu Yi, the Deputy Annalist, to select some venerable monks to perform Buddhist ceremonies. On hearing this
command Fu Yi sent up a memorial requesting a ban on the building of pagodas and saying that there was no
Buddha. It read:
By the Law of the West there are no distinctions between ruler and subject or between father and son; the
Three Paths and the Six Roads are used to deceive the foolish; past sins are chased away to filch future
blessings; and Sanskrit prayers are recited in attempts to avoid retribution. Now birth, death and the length of
life are in fact decided by nature; and punishments, virtue, power and blessings come from the lord of men.
But these days vulgar believers distort the truth and say that they all come from Buddha. In the time of the
Five Emperors and Three Kings of antiquity this Buddha did not exist, yet rulers were enlightened, subjects
were loyal, and prosperity lasted for many a long year. When foreign gods were first established in the time of
Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty, sramanas from the West began to propagate their religion. This is in
reality a foreign encroachment on China, and it does not merit belief.
When he had heard this read to him Taizong tossed it to his other officials for debate. The minister Xiao Yu
stepped forward from the ranks, kowtowed and said, "The Buddha's law has flourished for several dynasties,
and by spreading good and preventing evil it gives unseen help to the state; there is no reason why it would be
abolished. Buddha was a sage. Those who deny sages are lawless. I request that he be severely punished." Fu
Yi argued with Xiao Yu, pointing out that correct behavior was derived from serving one's parents and one's
sovereign, whereas the Buddha turned his back on his parents, resisting the Son of Heaven although he was
but a commoner, and rebelling against his mother and father with the body that they gave him. Xiao Yu had
not been born in an empty mulberry tree, but he honoured a religion that denied fathers; this indeed proved
that he who had no sense of filial piety denied his father.
All Xiao Yu did was to put his hands together and say, "Hell must have been made for men such as him."
Taizong sent for the High Chamberlain Zhang Daoyuan and the Head of the Secretariat Zhang Shiheng to ask
them how effectively Buddhist ritual obtained blessings.
"The Buddha dwells in purity, benevolence and mercy," the two officers replied, "and the True Result is
Buddha−emptiness. Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty placed the Three Teachings in an order. The
Chan Master Dahui wrote a poem in praise of the distant and mysterious. If the masses support monks,
anything can happen. The Five Patriarchs came down to their mothers' wombs, and Bodhidharma appeared.
From remotest antiquity everyone has said that the Three Teachings are highly venerable and cannot be
destroyed or abolished. We humbly beg Your Majesty to give us his perceptive ruling."
"Your submission makes sense," said the delighted Taizong. "If anyone else makes further comments, he will
be punished." He then ordered Wei Zheng, Xiao Yu and Zhang Daoyuan to invite all the monks and select one
of great virtue to be Master of Ceremonies. They all bowed to thank him and withdrew. From then on there
was a new law: anyone who injured a monk or slandered the Buddha would lose his arm.
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 171
The next day the three court officials assembled all the monks at the altar among rivers and hills, and they
went through them all one by one. From among them they chose a venerable and virtuous monk. Do you
know who he was?
Fully versed in the basic mystery, his title was Golden Cicada;
But because he did not want to hear the Buddha preach
He transferred to the mortal world to suffer torment,
Was born among the common mortals to fall into the net.
From the moment he entered the womb he met with evil,
Before he left it he encountered a gang of villains.
His father was Top Graduate Chen from Haizhou,
His grandfather a senior imperial commander.
His birth offended the meteor that dropped into the water,
He drifted with the current and followed the waves.
Jinshan Island had a great destiny:
The abbot Qian'an brought him up.
Only at seventeen did he meet his mother,
And go to the capital to find his grandfather.
Commander Yin Kaishan, raising a great army,
Wiped out and punished the bandits at Hongzhou.
Graduate Chen Guangrui escaped from the heavenly net,
And father and son were happily reunited.
Accepting the invitation he receives once more the monarch's grace,
And his fame is spread as he climbs the lofty tower.
Refusing to take office he wants to be a monk,
So as sramana of the Hongfu Temple he learns about the Way,
The child of an ancient Buddha who used to be called Jiangliu,
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 172
And took the dharma−name of Chen Xuanzang.
That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy,
and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was
an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and
had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour
and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. Investigation revealed that his origins were good and his
virtue great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not
know; he could sing every Buddhist chant and knew all the religious music. The three officials took him to the
imperial presence, where they danced and stirred up the dust. When they had bowed they reported, "Your
subject Xiao Yu and the rest of us have chosen a venerable monk called Chen Xuanzang in obedience to the
imperial decree."
On hearing his name Taizong thought deeply for a long time and then asked, "Is that the Xuanzang who is the
son of Grand Secretary Chen Guangrui?"
"Your subject is he," replied Xuanzang with a kowtow.
"Then you were indeed well chosen," said the Emperor with satisfaction. "You are indeed a monk of virtuous
conduct of a mind devoted to meditation. I give you the offices of Left Controller of the Clergy, Right
Controller of the Clergy, and Hierarch of the Empire." Xuanzang kowtowed to express his thanks and
accepted the appointments. The Emperor then gave him a multicolored golden cassock and a Vairocana miter,
telling him to be sure he conscientiously continued to visit enlightened monks, and giving him the position at
the top of the hierarchy. He gave him a decree in writing ordering him to go to the Huasheng Temple to pick a
propitious day and hour on which to begin the recitations of the scriptures.
Xuanzang bowed, took the decree, and went to the Huasheng Temple where he assembled many monks, had
meditation benches made, prepared for the mass, and chose the music. He selected a total of twelve hundred
high and humble monks of enlightenment, who he divided into an upper, a middle and a lower hall. All the
holy objects were neatly arranged before all the Buddhas. The third day of the ninth month of that year was
chosen an auspicious day on which to start the seven times seven days of the Great Land and Water Mass.
This was all reported to the throne, and at the appointed time Taizong, the high civil and military officials, and
the royal family went to the service to burn incense and listen to the preaching. There is a poem to prove it
that goes:
At the dragon assembly in the thirteenth year of Zhen Guan
The Emperor called a great meeting to talk about the scriptures.
At the assembly they began to expound the unfathomable law,
While clouds glowed above the great shrine.
The Emperor in his grace orders the building of a temple;
The Golden Cicada sheds his skin to edify the West.
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 173
He spreads the news that rewards for goodness save from ill,
Preaching the doctrine of the three Buddhas of past and future.
In the year jisi, the thirteenth of Zhen Guan, on the day jiaxu, the third of the ninth month, the Hierarch Chen
Xuanzang assembled twelve hundred venerable monks at the Huasheng Temple in the city of Chang'an for a
chanting of all the holy scriptures. After morning court was over the Emperor left the throne hall in his dragon
and phoenix chariot at the head of a host of civil and military officials and went to the temple to burn incense.
What did the imperial chariot look like? Indeed
Propitious vapours filled the sky
That shone with ten thousand beams of sacred light.
A mellow breeze blew softly,
The sunlight was strangely beautiful.
A thousand officials with jade at their belts walked in due order.
The banners of the five guards are drawn up on either side.
Holding golden gourds,
Wielding battle−axes,
They stand in pairs;
Lamps of purple gauze,
Imperial censers,
Make majestic clouds.
Dragons fly and phoenixes dance,
Ospreys and eagles soar.
True is the enlightened Son of Heaven,
Good are his just and loyal ministers.
This age of prosperity surpasses the time of Shun and Yu;
The eternal peace he has given outdoes that of Yao and Tang.
Under a parasol with curved handle
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 174
The dragon robe sweeps in,
Dazzling bright.
Interlocking jade rings,
Coloured phoenix fans,
Shimmer with a magic glow.
Pearl crowns and belts of jade,
Gold seals on purple cords.
A thousand regiments of soldiers protect the imperial chariot,
Two lines of generals carry the royal chair.
Bathed and reverent, the Emperor comes to worship the Buddha,
Submitting to the True Achievement as he joyfully burns incense.
When the carriage of the Tang Emperor reached the temple, orders were given to stop the music as he
descended from the vehicle and went at the head of his officials to bow to the Buddha and burn incense. When
he had done this three times he looked up and saw what a magnificent assembly it was:
Dancing banners,
Flying canopies.
When the banners danced
The sky shook with the clouds of silk;
When the canopies flew
The sun gleamed as the red lightning flashed.
Perfect the image of the statue of the Honoured One,
Mighty the grandeur of the Arhats' countenances.
Magic flowers in a vase,
Censers burning sandalwood and laka.
As the fairy flowers stand in vases
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 175
Trees like brocade fill the temple with their brightness.
As the censers burn sandalwood and laka
Clouds of incense rise to the azure heaven.
Fresh fruit of the season is piled in vermilion dishes,
Exotic sweets are heaped on the silk−covered tables.
Serried ranks of holy monks intone the surras
To save abandoned souls from suffering.
Taizong and his civil and military officials all burned incense, bowed to the golden body of the Lord Buddha,
and paid their respects to the Arhats. The Hierarch Chen Xuanzang then led all the monks to bow to the
Emperor, and when this was over they divided into their groups and went to their meditation places while the
Hierarch showed the Emperor the notice about the delivery of the lonely ghosts. It read:
"Mysterious is the ultimate virtue, and the Sect of Meditation leads to Nirvana. The purity of the truth is
all−knowing; it pervades the Three Regions of the universe. Through its countless changes it controls the
Negative and Positive; unbounded are the embodiments of the eternal reality. In considering those forlorn
ghosts one should be deeply distressed. At the sacred command of Taizong we have assembled some chosen
monks for meditation and preaching. He has opened wide the gates of enlightenment and rowed far the boat of
mercy, saving all the beings in the sea of suffering, and delivering those who had long been afflicted by the
six ways of existence. They will be led back to the right road and revel in the great chaos; in action and in
passivity they will be at one with primal simplicity. For this wonderful cause they are invited to see the purple
gates of the pure capital, and through our assembly they will escape from the confines of Hell to climb to the
World of Bliss and be free, wandering as they please in the Paradise of the West. As the poem goes:
A burner of incense of longevity,
A few spells to achieve rebirth.
The infinite Law is proclaimed,
The boundless mercy of Heaven is shown.
When sins are all washed away,
The neglected souls leave Hell.
We pray to protect our country;
May it stay at peace and be blessed."
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 176
When he had read this the Tang Emperor's heart was filled with happiness and he said to the monks, "Hold
firm to your sincerity and never allow yourselves a moment's slackness in the service of the Buddha. Later on,
when the Assembly is over, you will be blessed and we shall richly reward you. You shall certainly not have
labored in vain." The twelve hundred monks all kowtowed to thank him. When the three vegetarian meals for
the day were over the Tang Emperor went back to the palace. He was invited to come back to the Grand
Assembly to burn incense once more on the seventh day. As evening was now drawing in all the officials
went away. It was a fine evening:
A light glow suffused the boundless sky;
A few crows were late in finding their roosts.
Lamps were lit throughout the city as all fell still;
It was just the hour for the monks to enter the trance.
We will omit a description of the night or of how the monks intoned the scriptures when their master took his
seat again the next morning.
The Bodhisattva Guanyin from Potaraka Island in the Southern Sea had been long in Chang'an, looking on the
Buddha's orders for the man to fetch the scriptures, but she had not yet found anyone really virtuous. Then she
heard that Taizong was propagating the True Achievement and selecting venerable monks for a Grand
Assembly, and when she saw that the Master of Ceremonies was the monk Jiangliu who was really a Buddha's
son came down from the realms of supreme bliss, an elder whom she herself had led into his earthly mother's
womb, she was very pleased. She took her disciple Moksa and the treasures that the Buddha had given her out
on the street to offer them for sale.
Do you know what these treasures were? There was a precious brocade cassock and−a monastic staff with
nine rings. She also had those three golden bands, but she put them away safely for future use; she was only
selling the cassock and the staff.
There was a monk in Chang'an city too stupid to be chosen for the service but who nonetheless had some
ill−gotten banknotes. When he saw the bald, scabby, barefoot figure wearing a tattered robe−−the form the
Bodhisattva had taken−−offering the cassock of dazzling beauty for sale he went up and asked, "How much
d'you want for that cassock, Scabby?"
"The price of the cassock is five thousand ounces of silver and the staff two thousand," replied the
Bodhisattva. The stupid monk roared with laughter.
"You must be a nutcase, Scabby, or else a dope. Those two lousy things wouldn't be worth that much unless
they gave you immortality and turned you into a Buddha. No deal. Take'em away."
Not bothering to argue, the Bodhisattva walked on with Moksa. After they had been going for quite a long
time they found themselves in front of the Donghua Gate of the palace, where the minister Xiao Yu happened
to be returning home from morning court. Ignoring the crowd of lictors who were shouting to everyone to get
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 177
out of the way, the Bodhisattva calmly went into the middle of the road with the cassock in her hands and
headed straight for the minister. When the minister reined in his horse to look he saw the cassock gleaming
richly and sent an attendant to ask its price.
"I want five thousand ounces of silver for the cassock and two thousand for the staff," said the Bodhisattva.
"What's so good about the cassock to make it worth that much?" asked Xiao Yu.
"On the one hand it is good and on the other it isn't," replied the Bodhisattva. "On the one hand it has a price
and on the other it hasn't."
"What's good about it and what isn't?" asked the minister.
"Whoever wears this cassock of mine will not sink into the mire, will not fall into Hell, will not be ensnared
by evil and will not meet disaster from tiger or wolf: these are its good points. But as for a stupid monk who is
greedy and debauched, who takes delight in the sufferings of others, does not eat vegetarian food, and breaks
the monastic bans; or a common layman who harms the scriptures and slanders the Buddha−−such people
have great difficulty even in seeing this cassock of mine: that is its disadvantage."
"What did you mean by saying that it both has a price and hasn't got one?" asked the minister, continuing his
questions.
"Anyone who doesn't obey the Buddha's Law or honour the Three Treasures but still insists on buying the
cassock and the staff will have to pay seven thousand ounces for them: in that case they have a price. But if
anyone who honors the Three Treasures, takes pleasure in goodness, and believes in our Buddha, wants to
have them, then I'll give him the cassock and staff as a gift. In that case they have no price." Xiao Yu's cheeks
coloured, showing that he was a good man, and he dismounted to greet the Bodhisattva.
"Elder of the Great Law," he said, "forgive me. Our Great Tang Emperor is a true lover of goodness, and
every one of the civil and military officials in his court acts piously. This cassock would be just right for the
Hierarch, Master Chen Xuanzang, to wear in the Great Land and Water Mass that is now being conducted.
You and I shall go into the palace to see His Majesty."
The Bodhisattva gladly followed him as he turned around and went straight in through the Donghua Gate. The
eunuchs reported their arrival, and they were summoned to the throne hall. Xiao Yu led the two scabby monks
in, and they stood beneath the steps of the throne.
"What have you come to report, Xiao Yu?" the Emperor asked. Xiao Yu prostrated himself in front of the
steps and replied, "When your subject went out through the Donghua Gate I met two monks who were selling
a cassock and a staff. It occurred to me that this cassock would be suitable for Master Xuanzang to wear. So I
have brought the monks for an audience with Your Majesty." The delighted Taizong asked how much the
cassock cost. Still standing beneath the steps, and not making any gestures of courtesy, the Bodhisattva and
Moksa replied, "The cassock costs five thousand ounces of silver, and the staff two thousand."
"What advantages does the cassock have to make it worth so much?" the Emperor asked. To this the
Bodhisattva replied:
"This cassock
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 178
Has a strand of dragon cape,
To save from being eaten by the Roc,
And a thread of a stork jacket,
To deliver from mortality and lead to sainthood.
When one sits
Ten thousand spirits come to pay homage;
In all your actions
The Seven Buddhas will be with you.
"This cassock is made of silk reeled from giant ice−worms,
Twisted into yarn by skilful craftsmen,
Woven by fairy beauties,
Finished by goddesses.
The strips of cloth are joined with embroidered seams,
Each piece thick with brocade.
The openwork decoration has a flower pattern
Shimmering with color, shining with jeweled beauty.
The wearer of the cassock is wreathed in red mist,
And when it is taken off, coloured clouds fly.
Its primal light slipped out through the Three Gates of Heaven,
The magic vapour arose before the Five Sacred Peaks.
It is embroidered with layer upon layer of passion−flowers,
And gleams with pearls that shine like stars.
At the four corners are night−shining pearls,
Set at the top is an emerald.
Although it does not completely illuminate the Original Body
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 179
It shines with the light of the Eight Treasures.
"This cassock
Is normally kept folded,
And will only be worn by a sage.
When kept folded,
A rainbow shines through its thousand layers of wrapping;
When it is worn by a sage,
It will astonish the heavenly spirits and scare all demons.
On top is an as−you−wish pearl,
A Mani Pearl,
A dust−repelling pearl,
And a wind−calming pearl;
There is also red agate,
Purple coral,
Night−shining pearls,
And relics of the Buddha.
They steal the white of the moon,
Rival the sun in redness.
Their magic essence fills the sky,
Their auspicious light honors the sage.
Their magic essence fills the sky,
Shining through the gates of Heaven;
Their auspicious light honors the sage,
Illuminating the whole world.
Shining on mountains and rivers,
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 180
The essence frightens tigers and leopards;
Illuminating oceans and islands,
The light startles fishes and dragons.
At the side are two rows of gold−plated hooks,
At the neck are loops of whitest jade."
There is a poem that goes:
"Great are the Three Jewels, and honoured be the Way;
The Four Kinds of Life and Six Paths are all explained.
Whoever knows and teaches the law of Man and Heaven,
Can pass on the lamp of wisdom when he sees his original nature.
It protects the body and makes it a world of gold,
Leaves body and mind pure as an ice−filled jar of jade.
Ever since Buddha made his cassock
No one will ever dare to end the priesthood."
When the Tang Emperor heard these words spoken in his throne hall he was filled with joy, and he asked
another question: "Monk, what is so wonderful about your nine−ringed staff?"
"This staff of mine," the Bodhisattva replied, "is:
A nine−ringed iron staff inlaid with copper,
A nine−sectioned Immortal's cane to preserve eternal youth.
Held in your hand it's as light as a bone,
As you go down the mountain it brings white clouds.
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 181
The Fifth Patriarch took it through the gates of Heaven;
When Lo Bu searched for his mother he used it to smash the gates of Earth.
Untouched by the filth of mortal dust,
It gladly accompanies the godly monk as he climbs the jade mountain."
The Tang Emperor then ordered that the cassock be unfolded. On examining it from top to bottom he saw that
it was indeed a fine article.
"Elder of the Great Law," he said, "I tell you truthfully that I am now propagating the good word and widely
sowing seeds of blessing. At this moment many monks are assembled at the Huasheng Monastery for
recitation of the surras. Among them is one monk of outstanding virtue whose Buddha−name is Xuanzang,
and we wish to buy those two treasures of yours to give him. So what is your price?"
The Bodhisattva and Moksa put their hands together, intoned the name of the Buddha, and bowed down. "If
he really is a virtuous monk," she said, "I shall give them to him, and I refuse to accept any money for them."
With that she turned and left.
The Emperor immediately told Xiao Yu to stop her as he rose to his feet and called out, "You told us that you
wanted five thousand ounces for the cassock and two thousand for the staff, but now that we have said we
shall buy them, you refuse to take any money. Are you going to say that I abused my power to seize your
things? We would never dream of it. We shall pay the price you asked, and will take no refusal."
Raising her hand the Bodhisattva said, "I made a vow that I would give them free to anyone who honoured the
Three Treasures, delighted in goodness, and believed in our Buddha. Now I have seen that Your Majesty is a
good and virtuous respecter of our Buddhist faith, and have heard that there is a monk of virtuous conduct
who preaches the Great Law, it is only right that I should offer them to him; I don't want any money for them.
I am leaving the things here. Good−bye." The Tang Emperor was very pleased with the monk's sincerity, and
ordered that a large vegetarian banquet be given to thank him in the Imperial Kitchen. This the Bodhisattva
refused to accept and went airily off. There is no need to describe how she returned to her hide−out in the
local god's temple.
Taizong arranged for a court to be held at midday and sent Wei Zheng with a decree summoning Xuanzang to
attend. He found the monastic official assembling the monks as he climbed the rostrum for the chanting of
surras and gathas. The moment he heard the decree he came down from the rostrum, tidied his clothes, and
went with Wei Zheng to the imperial presence.
"Up till now we have had nothing suitable with which to thank you, Your Grace, for your efforts in acquiring
merit. This morning Xiao Yu met two monks who have vowed to give you a precious brocade cassock and a
nine−ringed monk's staff. We have therefore sent for you, Master, to come and receive them," said the
Emperor. Xuanzang kowtowed in thanks.
"If you do not reject it, Your Grace, let us see what it looks like on you." Xuanzang shook it open, draped it
across his shoulders, took the staff in his hand, and stood respectfully before the steps of the throne. The
monarch and all his ministers were overjoyed. He truly was a son of the Tathagata. Look at him:
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 182
How elegant his imposing features;
His Buddha−vestments fit as if they had been made for him.
The glow radiating from them fills Heaven and Earth,
While the colours crystallize in the sky.
Rows of gleaming pearls above and below,
Layers of golden threads joining front and back.
A hood edged with brocade,
Embroidered with ten thousand strange designs.
Patterns of the Eight Treasures hold the threads of the buttons,
While the golden collar is fastened with catches of velvet.
The Buddha−Heavens are set out in order of eminence,
While to left and right are the high and humble stars.
Great is the destiny of Xuanzang Master of the Law,
Who is worthy to accept this gift at present.
He is just like a living Arhat,
Excelling the Enlightened One of the West.
On the monkish staff the nine rings clink,
And richly glows the Vairocana miter.
How true that be is a Buddha's son;
It is no lie that he has surpassed enlightenment.
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 183
All the civil and military officials cried out with admiration, and the Emperor was delighted. Telling the
Master of the Law to put the cassock on properly and take the staff, he granted him two bands of ceremonial
attendants and had a host of officials see him out of the palace and walk with him to his monastery. It was just
like the procession for a top graduate in the palace examination. Xuanzang bowed once more to thank the
Emperor and then set out, striding majestically along the highway. All the travelling merchants, the
shop−keepers, the fashionable young men, the professional scribes, the men and women, young and old, in the
city of Chang'an fought to get a look at him and praise him.
"What a splendid Master of the Law," they said. "He's an Arhat come down to earth, a living Bodhisattva
come to see us mortals." Xuanzang went straight to his monastery, where all the monks left their places of
meditation to welcome him. When they saw the cassock he was wearing and the staff in his hand they all said
that King Ksitigarbha had come, did homage to him, and stood in attendance to right and left. Ascending the
main hall, Xuanzang burned incense and worshipped Buddha, and when he had given an account of the
Emperor's grade they all returned to their seats for meditation. Nobody noticed that the red wheel of the sun
was now sinking in the West.
As the sun sinks, plants and trees are veiled in mist
While the capital echoes to the bell and drum.
After three chimes of the bell nobody moves:
The streets throughout the city are still.
The monastery gleams with the light of its lamps;
The village is lonely and silent.
The Chan monks enter the trance and repair damaged sutras.
A good way to purify oneself of evil and nourish the true nature.
Time passed in the snap of a finger, and it was time for the special assembly on the seventh day, so Xuanzang
wrote a memorial inviting the Tang Emperor to come and burn incense. His reputation for piety had now
spread throughout the empire. Taizong therefore led a large number of civil and military officials and his
empresses, consorts and their families to the monastery in a procession of carriages to the temple early that
morning. Everyone in the city, whether young or old, humble or mighty, went to the temple to hear the
preaching.
The Bodhisattva said to Moksa, "Today is a special day of the Great Mass of Land and Water, which will go
on from this first seventh day to the seventh seventh day, as is proper. You and I are going to mingle with the
crowds for three reasons: to see the service, to see the Golden Cicada enjoying the blessing of wearing our
treasure, and to hear what branch of the scriptures he preaches on." The pair of them went to the temple. They
were fated to meet their old acquaintance, just as the Wisdom returned to its own preaching place. When they
went inside the monastery they saw that this great and heavenly dynasty surpassed any other in the world;
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 184
while the Jetavana Monastery and Sravana were no match for this temple. Sacred music sounded clear above
the shouting of Buddha names. When the Bodhisattva approached the preaching dais she saw in Xuanzang the
likeness of the wise Golden Cicada. As the poem goes:
Pure in every image, free of every speck of dirt,
The great Xuanzang sat on his lofty dais.
The lonely souls who have been delivered come in secret,
While the well−born arrive to hear the law.
Great is his wisdom in choosing suitable methods;
All his life he has opened the doors of the scriptures.
As they watch him preach the infinite Law,
The ears of young and old alike are filled with joy.
As Guanyin went to the temple preaching hall
She met an old acquaintance who was no common mortal.
He spoke about every current matter,
And mentioned the achievements of many a mortal era.
The clouds of the Dharma settle over every mountain,
The net of the teaching spreads right across the sky.
If one counts the number of pious thoughts among humans
They are as plentiful as raindrops on red blossom.
On his dais the Master of the Law read through the Sutra to Give Life and Deliver the Dead, discussed the
Heavenly Charm to Protect the Country and preached on the Exhortation to Cultivate Merit. The Bodhisattva
went up to the dais, hit it, and shouted out at the top of her voice, "Why are you only talking about the
doctrine of the Little Vehicle, monk? Can you preach about the Great Vehicle?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 185
On hearing these questions a delighted Xuanzang leapt down from the preaching dais, bowed to the
Bodhisattva, and said, "Venerable teacher, your disciple has sinned grievously in failing to recognize you. We
monks who stand before you only preach the law of the Little Vehicle, and we know nothing of the doctrine
of the Great Vehicle."
"That doctrine of the Little Vehicle of yours will never bring the dead to rebirth; it's only good enough for a
vulgar sort of enlightenment. Now I have the Three Stores of the Buddha's Law of the Great Vehicle that will
raise the dead up to Heaven, deliver sufferers from their torments, and free souls from the eternal coming and
going."
As the Bodhisattva was talking, the Master of Incense, an official who patrolled the temple, made an urgent
report to the Tang Emperor that just when the Master of the Law was in the middle of preaching the
wonderful Law a pair of scabby itinerant monks had dragged him down and were engaging him in wild
argument. The Emperor ordered them to be arrested and brought before him, and a crowd of men hustled the
two of them into the rear hall of the monastery.
When they saw Taizong they neither raised their hands in greeting nor bowed, but looked him in the eye and
said, "What does Your Majesty want to ask us about."
Recognizing them, the Emperor asked, "Are you not the monk who gave us the cassock?"
"That's right," replied the Bodhisattva.
"If you came here to listen to the preaching you should be satisfied with getting something to eat," said
Taizong. "Why did you start ranting at the Master of the Law, disturbing the scripture hall and interfering with
our service to the Buddha?"
"That master of yours was only teaching the doctrine of the Little Vehicle, which will never send the dead up
to Heaven," replied the Bodhisattva. "I have the Three Stores of the Buddha's Law of the Great Vehicle,
which can save the dead, deliver from suffering, and ensure that the body will live for ever without coming to
harm." Showing no signs of anger, Taizong earnestly asked where the Buddha's Law of the Great Vehicle
was.
"It is in the Thunder Monastery in the land of India in the West, where our Buddha lives," the Bodhisattva
replied, "and it can untie the knots of all injustice and save the innocent from disaster."
"Can you remember it?" the Emperor asked, and the Bodhisattva answered "Yes." Taizong then gave orders
that this Master of the Law was to be taken to the dais and invited to preach.
The Bodhisattva and Moksa flew up to the dais, then soared into the sky on magic clouds. She appeared in her
own form as the deliverer from suffering, holding a twig of willow in a vase, and Moksa stood beside her as
Huian, holding a stick and bristling with energy. The Tang Emperor was so happy that he bowed to Heaven,
while his civil and military officials all fell to their knees and burned incense. Everyone in the
temple−−monks, nuns, clerics, lay people, scholars, workmen and merchants−−all bowed down and prayed,
"Good Bodhisattva, good Bodhisattva." There is a description of her appearance:
The sacred radiance shines around her,
The holy light protects her Dharma body.
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 186
In the glory of the highest Heaven
Appears a female Immortal.
The Bodhisattva
Wore on her head
Marvellous pearl tassels
With golden clasps,
Set with turquoise,
And gleaming golden.
She wore on her body
A plain blue robe with flying phoenixes,
Pale−coloured,
Patterned with running water,
On which curled golden dragons.
Before her breast hung
A moon−bright,
Wind−dancing,
Pearl−encrusted,
Jade−set circlet full of fragrance.
Around her waist was
A skirt of embroidery and brocade from the Jade Pool
Made from the silk of ice−silkworms,
With golden seams,
That rode on coloured clouds.
Before her went
A white and yellow red−beaked parrot,
To fly across the Eastern Ocean,
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 187
And all over the world
In gratitude and duty.
The vase she held gave grace and salvation,
And in the vase was a sprig of
Weeping willow to sweep away the fog,
Scattering water on the heavens,
Cleansing all evil.
Rings of jade looped over brocade buttons
And her golden−lotus feet were concealed.
She was able to visit the three heavens,
For she was Guanyin, the rescuer from suffering.
Taizong was so entranced that he forgot all about his empire; the ministers and generals were so captivated
that they forgot all about court etiquette; and the masses all intoned, "Glory be to the Bodhisattva Guanyin."
Taizong ordered that a skilled painter was to make a true likeness of the Bodhisattva, and no sooner had the
words left his mouth than the brilliant and enlightened portrayer of gods and Immortals, Wu Daozi, was
chosen. He was the man who later did the pictures of distinguished ministers in the Cloud−piercing Pavilion.
Wielding his miraculous brush, he painted a true likeness on the spot. The Bodhisattva's magic cloud slowly
faded into the distance, and a moment later the golden light could be seen no more. All that was visible was a
note drifting down from the sky on which could be read the following brief address in verse:
"Greetings to the lord of the Great Tang.
In the West are miraculous scriptures.
Although the road is sixty thousand miles long,
The Great Vehicle will offer its help.
When these scriptures are brought back to your country
They will save devils and deliver the masses.
If anyone is willing to go for them,
His reward will be a golden body."
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 188
When he had read these lines Taizong issued an order to the assembly of monks: "Suspend this service until
we have sent someone to fetch the scriptures of the Great Vehicle, and then you shall once more strive
sincerely to achieve good retribution." The monks all obeyed his instructions. The Emperor then asked those
present in the monastery, "Who is willing to accept our commission to go to the Western Heaven to visit the
Buddha and fetch the scriptures?"
Before he had finished his question, the Master of the Law came forward, bowed low in greeting, and said,
"Although I am lacking in ability, I would like to offer my humble efforts to fetch the true scriptures for Your
Majesty and thus ensure the eternal security of your empire." The Tang Emperor, who was overjoyed to hear
this, went forward to raise him to his feet.
"Master," he said, "if you are prepared to exert your loyalty and wisdom to the full, not fearing the length of
the journey or the rivers and mountains you will have to cross, I shall make you my own sworn brother."
Xuanzang kowtowed to thank him. As the Tang Emperor was indeed a man of wisdom and virtue he went to a
place before the Buddha in the monastery where he bowed to Xuanzang four times, calling him "younger
brother" and "holy monk." Xuanzang thanked him effusively.
"Your Majesty," he said, "I have no virtue or talent that fits me for the sacred honour of being treated as your
kinsman. On this journey I shall give my all and go straight to the Western Heaven. If I fail to reach there or
to obtain the true scriptures, then I shall not return to this country even in death, and shall fall for eternity into
Hell." He burned incense in front of the Buddha to mark this vow. The happy Emperor ordered his chariot to
take him back to the palace; later on an auspicious day would be chosen on which Xuanzang would be given a
passport and set out. With that he returned and everyone dispersed.
Xuanzang went back to the Hongfu Monastery, where the many monks and his few personal disciples had
already heard that he was going to fetch the scriptures. They came to ask if it was true that he had vowed to go
to the Western Heaven. On being told by Xuanzang that it was indeed true, his pupils said, "Teacher, we have
heard that the journey to the Western Heaven is a long one, and that there are many tigers, leopards, fiends,
and demons on the way. We are afraid that you may lose you life and never come back."
"I have sworn a great vow that I shall fall into Hell for eternity if I do not get the true scriptures," replied
Xuanzang. "Besides, as I have been so favored by His Majesty, I shall have to show my loyalty to the utmost
if I am to repay the country for his honour. But it will be a journey into the unknown, and there is no saying
what my fate will be. My pupils," he went on to say, "two or three years after I set out, or it may be as much
as six or seven, that pine tree inside the monastery gate will turn to the East, which will mean that I am
coming back. If it does not, you can be sure that I will not return." All his disciples committed his words most
carefully to memory.
At court the next morning Taizong assembled his civil and military officials and wrote out the document
Xuanzang would need to fetch the scriptures, stamping it with the imperial seal that gave the right to travel
freely. When an imperial astrologer reported that this day was under an auspicious star for setting out on a
long journey, the Tang Emperor was delighted. A eunuch official came in to report, "The Imperial Younger
Brother, the Master of the Law, awaits a summons outside the palace doors." Calling him into the throne hall,
Taizang said, "Brother, today is a lucky one for starting on a journey, and here is the pass that will let you
through the checkpoints. I am also giving you a golden bowl with which you may beg for food on your
journey, in addition to choosing two experienced travelers to accompany you and presenting you with a horse
to carry you on your long journey. You may now set out." Xuanzang, who was very happy to hear this,
thanked the Emperor and took the presents. He was now more eager than ever to be off. Taizong and a host of
officials went by carriage to accompany him to the checkpoint. When they got there they found that the
Journey to the West
Chapter 12 189
monks of the Hongfu Monastery and Xuanzang's own disciples were waiting outside with his summer and
winter clothing. As soon as he saw this the Tang Emperor ordered that it be packed and horses be provided,
then told an official to pour out some wine. Raising his cup he asked, "Brother, what is your courtesy name?"
"As I am not of the world, I do not have one," replied Xuanzang. "The Bodhisattva said yesterday that there
are Three Stores (son zang) of scriptures in the Western Heaven. You, brother, should take a courtesy name
from this. What about Sanzang?"
Thanking the Emperor for his kindness, he accepted the cup of wine with the words, "Your Majesty, liquor is
the first of the things from which a monk must abstain, and so I have never drunk it."
"Today's journey is exceptional," Taizong replied, "and besides, this is a nonalcoholic wine, so you should
drink this cup and let us feel that we have seen you off properly." Unable to refuse any longer, Sanzang took
the wine, and was on the point of drinking it when he saw Taizong bend down, take a pinch of dust in his
fingers, and flick it into his cup. Seeing Sanzang's incomprehension, Taizong laughed and said,
"Dear brother, when will you return from this journey to the Western Heaven?"
"I shall be back in this country within three years," Sanzang replied. "The days and years will be long, the
mountains will be high, and the road will lead you far away," said Taizong, "so you should drink this wine to
show that you have more love for a pinch of dust from home than fir thousands of ounces of foreign gold."
Only then did Sanzang understand the significance of the pinch of dust, and thanking the Emperor once more
he drained the cup, took his leave of him, and went out through the checkpoint. The Emperor went back to the
palace.
If you don't know what happened on the journey, listen to the explanation in the next installment.

Chapter 13 190
It has been told already how Sanzang was seen off at the checkpoint outside Chang'an by the Tang Emperor
and a host of officials on the twelfth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of Zhen Guan. For two days
his horse's hoofs were never still, and he soon reached the Fa Men Monastery, where the abbot came out to
meet him at the head of five hundred and more monks drawn up in two lines. Taking Sanzang inside, he
greeted him, offered him tea, and then gave him a monastic meal. By the time the meal was over night had
fallen.
As it approached the Milky Way,
The moon was free from any dust.
The wild goose called to the distant traveler,
While washing−boards could be heard by neighbors.
Roosting birds perch in the withered trees;
The dhyana monks chant Sanskrit music.
On their seats with hassocks of rushes
They sit until the middle of the night.
In the lamplight the monks were discussing the true teachings of the Buddhist faith and the reasons for going
to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. Some said that there would be wide rivers and high mountains
to cross, some that there would be many a tiger and leopard along the way, some that the lofty ranges and
cliffs would be hard to cross, and some that there would be evil demons and foul fiends difficult to subdue.
Sanzang kept his lips sealed; he said nothing, only pointing to his heart and nodding occasionally.
The monks, unable to understand what he meant, put their hands together and asked, "Why do you point to
your heart and nod your head, Master?"
"When the heart and mind live," Sanzang replied, "every kind of evil lives; but when they are extinguished,
evil is extinguished too. I made a great vow to the Buddha in the Huasheng Monastery that if I failed to
achieve this mission it would not be for lack of trying. I am determined to reach the Western Heaven, where I
may see the Buddha and ask for the scriptures, so that the Wheel of the Law may revolve, and our sage
Emperor enjoy eternal security."
On hearing his words the monks all expressed their admiration, saying as if with one voice, "What a loyal and
brave Hierarch." With praises still on their lips they invited the Master to go to bed and wished him a peaceful
night's sleep.
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 191
Before long the bamboo clappers were sounding for the setting moon, while the cocks greeted the dawn with
their crowing. The monks all got up and prepared tea and breakfast. Sanzang put on his cassock and went to
worship the Buddha in the main hall.
"Your disciple Chen Sanzang," he said, "is going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures, but my fleshly
eye is too dim to see the true image of the living Buddha. I now vow that whenever I come across a temple on
my journey I shall burn incense; whenever I see a Buddha's image I shall worship it; and whenever I pass a
stupa I shall sweep it. My only wish is that Buddha in his mercy will soon appear to me in his golden body
and give me the true scriptures to take back and propagate in the land of the East." When he had prayed he
went back to the abbot's room for breakfast. After breakfast his two attendants saddled the horse and set off at
a good pace. At the gate of the monastery Sanzang took his leave of the monks, who were so unwilling to be
parted from him that they accompanied him for some three miles before turning back with tears in their eyes,
while Sanzang carried on Westwards. It was autumn weather:
Leafless the village trees, and fallen the reed flowers;
The red leaves had dropped from maple and willow.
The way was foggy and damp, and few were the friends that he met.
Beautiful the yellow chrysanthemums,
Delicate the mountain spurs;
Sad to see the lotus withered now the water was cold.
White duckweed and red smartweed were turned to snow by the frost.
Solitary ducks coming down from the clouds, dropping from the sky,
Where pale and wispy clouds were scudding.
The swallows had departed,
The migrant geese were here,
And their honking shattered the night.
When the master and his attendants had been travelling for several days they reached the city of Gongzhou,
where all the local officials were waiting to greet them and take them into the city. After a night's rest they set
out again the next morning. They ate when they were hungry and drank when they were thirsty, travelling by
day and stopping at night. Two or three days later they reached the garrison city of Hezhou, which was on the
frontier of the Great Tang Empire. The garrison commander and the local Buddhist monks and priests had all
heard that the Master of the Law, the Imperial Younger Brother, was going to the West on His Majesty's
orders to see the Buddha, so they were all very respectful. The Director of Monks took him into the city,
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 192
provided him with all he needed, and invited him spend the night in the Fuyuan Monastery. All the monks of
the monastery came to pay their respects to him, and when he had finished the meal they prepared for him he
told his attendants to give the horse a good feed as they would be setting out before dawn. As soon as the
cocks started to crow he called for his attendants, thus disturbing the monks, who brought him tea and food.
When he had eaten he crossed the frontier.
In his impatience Sanzang had got up too soon. As it was late autumn the cocks had crowed very early, and it
was still only about two in the morning. The three of them−−four, including the horse−−covered about a
dozen miles through the frost, finding their way by the light of the moon, until they saw a large mountain in
front of them. They had to push the undergrowth aside as they looked for their way, and the going was
indescribably rough and difficult. Just when they were wondering whether they were lost, all three of them
and the horse stumbled and fell into a pit.
Sanzang was thrown into a panic, and his attendants were trembling with fear, when to add their terror they
heard roars coming from further inside and loud shouts of, "Get'em! Get'em!" With a ferocious blast of wind a
crowd of fifty or sixty fiends fell upon them and dragged them out. When the shivering and shaking Master of
the Law took a stealthy look he saw a thoroughly evil demon king sitting above them. Truly he was
Mighty of stature,
Ferocious of face.
His eyes flashed like lightning,
His thunderous voice shook the four quarters.
Protruding, saw−edged teeth;
Bared fangs like chisels.
His body was clad in brocade,
And his back was covered with its patterns.
A beard of steel concealing his face,
Hooked claws sharp as frost:
The white−browed king of the Southern mountain,
Feared by the Yellow Lord of the Eastern Sea.
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 193
The sight of him frightened Sanzang out of his wits and made his two attendants feel their bones turn to jelly
and their muscles go numb. When the demon king roared out an order to tie them up the fiends bound them
with rope. He was just on the point of devouring them when a great noise was heard outside and the arrival of
Mountain Lord Bear and Hermit Ox was announced. Sanzang looked up and saw that one of them was a dark
fellow. Can you imagine what he looked like?
A hero of great courage,
Light and strong in body,
Powerful in crossing rivers,
Showing his awesome might as he runs through the woods.
Always blessed with lucky dreams,
He now revealed his unique valour.
He could uproot and snap a green tree,
And when he left cold he could change the weather.
Clearly he shows his miraculous powers, For which he is known as the Mountain Lord.
Behind him Sanzang saw a fat man. Do you know what he looked like?
A hat with two towering horns,
His shoulders squarely set.
He liked to wear dull−coloured clothes,
And his pace was always sluggish.
His male ancestors were called Bull;
His mother was known as Cow,
As he could work for farmers,
His name was Hermit Ox.
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 194
When these two came swaggering in, the demon king rushed out to greet them. "General Yin," said Mountain
Lord Bear, "I must congratulate you: you're always so successful."
"General Yin," said Hermit Ox, "my felicitations on being ever−victorious."
"How have things been with you two gentlemen recently?" asked the demon king.
"Much as usual," replied Mountain Lord.
"I get by," answered the Hermit. These preliminaries over, the three of them sat down to laugh and joke
together.
Sanzang's two attendants meanwhile were howling pitifully in their bonds.
"How did those three get here?" asked the dark fellow.
"They delivered themselves to the front door," the demon king replied.
"Will you be serving them to your friends?" asked the Hermit with a smile.
"I should be honoured to," answered the demon king.
"We won't need them all," remarked the Mountain Lord. "We could eat two and keep the third." With a
"na−a−aw" of obedience the demon king told his servants to cut open the two attendants, scoop their hearts
out, and chop their bodies into mince. He presented the heads, hearts, and livers to his two guests, eating the
limbs himself and dividing the rest of the flesh and bones among the fiends. All that could be heard was a
crunching and a munching that sounded just like tigers devouring lambs, and in a few moments it had all been
eaten up. Sanzang was almost dead with fright, yet this was only his first tribulation, coming so soon after
leaving Chang'an.
In his despair he noticed that the East was beginning to grow light, and when dawn broke the two monsters
left, saying, "We have been handsomely entertained today, and we shall repay your hospitality in full another
day." With that they both rushed out. A moment later the red sun rose high in the sky, but Sanzang was too
befuddled to know where he was. Just when all seemed lost, an old man appeared, walking towards him with
the help of a stick. He came up to Sanzang, broke all his bonds with a wave of his hand, and revived him by
blowing into his face. Sanzang fell to his knees and bowed low to him, saying, "Thank you, venerable ancient,
for saving my humble life."
The old man returned his bow and said, "Get up. Have you lost anything?"
"My attendants have been eaten by monsters, and I don't know where my baggage or my horse is," replied
Sanzang.
The old man pointed with his stick and asked, "Isn't that a horse with two baggage−rolls over there?" When
Sanzang turned round he saw that his things had not been lost after all, which somewhat relieved his anxiety.
"Venerable sir," he asked, "What is this place, and how did you get here?"
"This is the Double Forked Mountain, where tigers and leopards make their dens. How did you fall in here?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 195
"I crossed the frontier at the garrison city of Hezhou at cockcrow, not realizing that I had got up too early,"
replied Sanzang. "Just as we were making our way through frost and dew we suddenly fell into this pit. A
dreadfully ferocious demon king appeared and had me and my attendants tied up. Then a dark fellow called
Mountain Lord Bear and a fat one called Hermit Ox came in, and they addressed the demon king as General
Yin. The three of them ate up my two attendants, and their party only ended at dawn. I cannot imagine why I
should have been fated with the good fortune of you coming to rescue me, venerable sir."
"The Hermit is a wild bull spirit, the Mountain Lord is a bear spirit, and General Yin is a tiger spirit," the old
man replied. "The fiends who serve him are mountain spirits, tree devils, monsters, and wolves. The reason
they did not eat you was because your fundamental nature is enlightened. Come with me and I'll show you the
way." Overcome with gratitude, Sanzang put the packs on his horse and led it by the bridle as he followed the
old man out of the pit and on to the main road. Tying the horse to a bush beside the road, he turned round to
bow low to the old man and thank him, but the old man changed into a puff of wind and rose into the sky on
the back of a red−crested white crane. All that could be seen was a piece of paper drifting down in the wind
with four lines of verse written on it:
"I am the Planet Venus of the Western Heaven,
Who came to save your life.
In the journey ahead you will have divine disciples:
Do not in your troubles feel angry with the scriptures."
When he had read this Sanzang worshipped Heaven and said, "Many thanks, Planet, for delivering me from
this danger." This done, he continued on his difficult journey, feeling very lonely as he led his horse along. On
this mountain there were
Cold rains and winds howling in the trees,
Streams splashing noisily down gullies,
Fragrant wild flowers,
Screens of rocks and boulders.
Deer and ape made raucous howls,
Roebuck and muntjac ran in herds.
Many were the songs of birds.
But there was no trace of man.
The abbot
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 196
Was trembling and uneasy;
His horse
Could barely lift its hoofs.
Sanzang did not spare himself as he pressed ahead amid the mountain peaks. He had been going for many
hours without seeing any sign of a human house; he was hungry and finding the going heavy. Just at this
critical moment he saw in front of him a pair of ferocious tigers roaring, while two long snakes were coiled up
behind him. To his left were venomous reptiles, and to his right were terrible monsters. Being by himself and
unable to think of a way out, Sanzang prepared to abandon his mind and body and let Heaven do as it would.
Besides, the horse's back was now so tired and its legs so bent that it fell to its knees on the ground and
collapsed. Sanzang could not move it, either by blows or by dragging at its bridle.
The poor Master of the Law, who had nowhere to shelter, was feeling thoroughly wretched, convinced that
nothing could save him from death. But when his troubles were at their worst someone came to his rescue.
Just when all seemed lost he saw the venomous reptiles and the evil monsters flee, while the tigers and the
snakes hid themselves. Sanzang looked up and saw a man coming across the hillside with a steel trident in his
hand and bow and arrows at his waist. Just look and see what a fine chap he was:
On his head
A leopard skin hat with artemisia patterns:
On his body
A coat of woollen cloth.
Round his waist was tied a lion belt,
On his feet a pair of deerskin boots.
His eyes were as round as an evil spirit's;
His curly beard was like the evil god of the moon's.
From his waist hung a bow with poisoned arrows,
And in his hand was a steel−tipped trident.
The thunder of his voice would make a wild beast tremble,
And his ferocity terrified the pheasants.
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 197
Seeing him approach, Sanzang knelt down beside the path, put his hands together, and shouted at the top of
his voice, "Spare me, bandit king, spare me." The man went over to him, put down his trident, and raised him
to his feet.
"Don't be frightened, venerable monk," he said, "I'm not a bad man; I'm a hunter who lives in these
mountains. My name is Liu Boqin and I am known as the warden of the mountain. I came along here because
I wanted a couple of animals for the pot. I never expected to meet you here−−I must have offended you."
"I am a monk sent by the Emperor of the Great Tang to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for
the scriptures," Sanzang replied. "I had just got here when I found myself completely surrounded by wolves,
tigers, snakes and other creatures, which meant that I could go no further. Then suddenly you appeared, High
Warden, and saved my life. Thank you very much indeed."
"Those of us who live here," replied Liu Boqin, "can only support ourselves by killing tigers and wolves, and
catching snakes and other reptiles, which is why all those animals fled in terror from me. As you are from the
Tang Empire, we are compatriots. This is still the territory of the Great Tang, and I am a Tang citizen. Both of
us depend on the Emperor's lands and rivers for our food and drink, and we are fellow−countrymen, so there
is nothing to fear. You must come with me to my hut, and your horse can rest. I'll take you on your way
tomorrow." Sanzang, who was delighted to hear this, thanked him and went along behind him, leading the
horse.
When they had crossed the mountainside they heard a sound like the howling of a wind. "Sit down here and
don't move, venerable monk," said Boqin. "That noise like a wind means that a mountain cat is coming. Just
wait a moment while I catch it, then I can take it home to feed you with." This news so terrified Sanzang that
he dared not move. The high warden was striding forward, brandishing his trident, to meet the animal, when a
striped tiger appeared in front of him. At the sight of Liu Boqin the animal turned to flee, but the high warden
let out a thunderclap of a shout: "Where d'you think you're going, wretch?" When the tiger realized that Liu
Boqin was in hot pursuit, it turned and charged him, baring its claws. The high warden raised his trident to
meet his opponent. At the sight of all this Sanzang collapsed on the grass, paralyzed with fear; never had he
seen anything so terrifying in all his born days. The tiger and the high warden fought a magnificent battle
under the mountain:
Bursting with anger,
Mad with rage.
Bursting with anger,
The warden bristled, immensely strong.
Mad with rage,
The striped tiger snorted out red dust as it showed its might.
One bared its teeth and brandished its claws,
The other twisted and turned.
The trident thrust against the heavens and blotted out the sun;
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 198
The patterned tail stirred up mist and clouds.
One made wild stabs at the chest,
The other struck at the head.
To avoid the blows was to win a new life;
A hit was an appointment with the King of Hell.
All that could be heard was the tiger bellowing
And the high warden shouting.
When the tiger bellowed,
Mountains and rivers split open, to the terror of birds and beasts.
At the high warden's shouts,
The sky was parted and the stars revealed.
The tiger's golden eyes were bulging with fury,
The hunter's valiant heart was full of wrath.
How admirable was high warden Liu of the mountain,
How splendid the lord of the beasts of the land.
As man and tiger fought for victory
Whoever weakened would lose his life.
After the pair of them had been fighting for about two hours the tiger's claws began to slacken as it grew tired,
and just then the high warden smote him full in the chest with his trident. Its points pierced the animal's liver
and heart, a pitiful sight. Within an instant the ground was covered with its blood as the hunter dragged it
along the path by its ears. What a man! Without panting, and with his expression unchanged, he said to
Sanzang, "What a piece of luck. This mountain cat will be enough! to feed you for a whole day." Sanzang was
full of praise for him.
"High Warden, you really are a mountain god."
"It was nothing," said Liu Boqin, "so please don't exaggerate. This is all the result of your blessings. Come on,
let's skin it and boil up some of its meat as soon as we can so as to get you fed." Holding his trident in one
hand and dragging the tiger with the other he led the way, while Sanzang followed, leading his horse. As they
wound their way across the mountain, a cottage suddenly came into view. In front of its gate there were:
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 199
Ancient trees reaching to the sky,
Wild creepers covering the path.
Cool were the wind and dust in the valleys,
Strange vapours coiled around the cliffs.
The scent of wild flowers was all along the path,
Deep, deep the green of the bamboos.
A thatched gatehouse,
A fenced yard,
Both pretty as a picture.
A stone bridge,
Whitewashed mud walls:
Charming austerity.
The loneliness of autumn,
Airy isolation.
Yellow leaves lay fallen beside the path,
White clouds drifted above the peaks.
Mountain birds sang in the woods
While a puppy barked outside the gate.
When he reached the gate, the high warden Liu Boqin threw down the tiger and shouted, "Where are you,
lads?" Three or four servants of strange and repulsive appearance came out, and with much pulling and
tugging they carried the tiger in. Boqin told them to skin it at once and prepare it to offer to their guest, then
turned round to welcome Sanzang in. When they had formally greeted each other Sanzang bowed to Boqin to
thank him for taking pity on him and saving his life.
"Why bother to thank me? We're fellow countrymen." When Sanzang had been offered a seat and served with
tea, an old woman came out to greet him followed by a young one. Liu Boqin explained that they were his
mother and his wife.
"Madam, please take the highest seat while I bow to you," said Sanzang.
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 200
"You are a guest from afar, venerable monk, so let us each preserve our dignity and neither bow to the other,"
the old woman replied.
"Mother," said Liu Boqin, "he has been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor to go to the Western Heaven to
see the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. I met him on the mountain, and I thought that as we were
fellow−countrymen I should invite him home to rest before I take him on his way tomorrow." The old woman
was delighted.
"Good, good," she said. "But it would be even better to ask him to stay longer. Tomorrow is the anniversary
of your father's passing away, and I would like to trouble the venerable monk to say some prayers and read a
sutra for him; you could take him on his way the day after." Although this Boqin was a tiger−killer and the
high warden of the mountain, he was a dutiful son, and when he heard this suggestion he made ready paper
and incense and asked Sanzang to stay.
While they talked they had not noticed the evening drawing in. The servants set out a table and stools, then
brought in several dishes of tender tiger−meat, which they placed steaming hot on the table. Liu Boqin asked
Sanzang to help himself while he served the rice. Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang
replied, "This is wonderful, but I must tell you frankly that I have been a monk ever since I left my mother's
womb, so I am quite unable to eat meat." Boqin thought for a while before replying, "Venerable monk, our
family has not eaten vegetarian food for generations. When we cut bamboo shoots, pick fungus, gather wild
vegetables for drying, or make bean−curd we always cook them in the fat of roebuck, deer, tiger or leopard, so
even they aren't really vegetarian; and our two cooking pots are steeped in fat, so what are we to do? I'm
afraid it was wrong of me to ask you here."
"There's no need to worry," Sanzang answered. "Please go ahead and eat. I'd go without food for four or five
days, or even starve, rather than break the monastic rule about vegetarian food."
"But we can't have you starving to death," protested Liu Boqin.
"Thanks to your great kindness, High Warden, I was saved from the packs of tigers and wolves. Even if I were
to starve to death, it would be better than providing a meal for tigers."
Liu Boqin's mother, who had been listening to their conversation, said, "Don't talk nonsense, son. I've got
some vegetarian things that we can offer to him."
"Where did you get them from?" Liu Boqin asked, to which mother replied, "Never you mind how, but I've
got them." She told her daughter−in−law to take down the little cooking−pot, burn the fat out of it, scrub it
and wash it several times over, then put it back on the stove. Then they half filled it with boiling water that
they threw away. Next she poured boiling water on mountain−elm leaves to make tea, boiled up some millet,
and cooked some dried vegetables. This was then all put into two bowls and set on the table. Then the old
woman said to Sanzang, "Please eat, venerable monk. This is completely pure tea and food that I and my
daughter−in−law have prepared." Sanzang thanked them and sat down in the seat of honour. Another place
was laid for Liu Boqin, where were set out bowls and dishes full of the meat of tiger, roebuck, snake, fox, and
hare, as well as dried venison, all cooked without salt or sauce, which he was going to eat while Sanzang had
his vegetarian meal. He had just sat down and was on the point of picking up his chopsticks when he noticed
Sanzang put his hands together to recite some scripture, which so alarmed him that instead of picking up his
chopsticks he stood beside him. When Sanzang had recited a few lines he urged Boqin to eat.
"Are you a short−sutra monk then?" Boqin asked.
"That wasn't a sutra, it was a grace before eating."
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 201
"You get up to all sorts of tricks. Fancy reciting sutras at mealtimes," was Boqin's comment.
When the meal was over and the dishes had been cleared away, Liu Boqin invited Sanzang out into the
gathering darkness for a stroll at the back. They went along an alley and came to a thatched hut. On pushing
the door open and going in Sanzang saw bows and crossbows hanging on the walls and quivers filled with
arrows. From the beams were slung two gory and stinking tiger−skins, and at the foot of the wall were stood
many spears, swords, tridents and clubs. In the middle were two seats. Liu Boqin urged Sanzang to sit down,
but Sanzang could not bear to stay there long among the horrifying filth, and so he went outside. Going
further to the back they came to a large garden full of clumps of yellow chrysanthemums and red maple−trees.
Then with a whinnying noise about a dozen plump deer and a large herd of roebuck ran out; they were docile
and unfrightened on seeing humans.
"Were those roebuck and deer raised by you?" asked Sanzang.
"Yes," replied Boqin. "When you Chang'an people have some money you buy valuables, and when you have
land you accumulate grain; but we hunters can only keep a few wild animals for a rainy day." Dusk had fallen
unnoticed as the two of them talked, and now they went back to the house to sleep.
Early the next morning the whole family, young and old, got up and prepared vegetarian food for the monk,
and then they asked him to start reciting sutras. Sanzang washed his hands, went to the family shrine of the
high warden, burned incense there, and worshipped, then beat his "wooden fish" as he recited first a prayer to
purify his mouth, then a holy spell to purify his body and mind, and finally the Sutra to Deliver the Dead.
When he had finished, Boqin asked him to write out a letter of introduction for the dead man and also recite
the Diamond Sutra and the Guanyin Sutra. Sanzang recited them in a loud, clear voice and then ate lunch,
after which he read out the several chapters of the Lotus Sutra, the Amitabha Sutra, as well as one chapter of
the Peacock Sutra and told the story of the cleansing of the bhikshu. By now it was dark, and when they had
burned all kinds of incense, paper money, and paper horses for all the gods, and the letter of introduction for
the dead man, the service was over and everyone went to bed and slept soundly.
The soul of Boqin's father, now delivered from being a drowned ghost, came to the house that night and
appeared in a dream to everyone in the family.
"I suffered long in the underworld, unable to find deliverance," he said, "but now that the saintly monk has
wiped out my sins by reading some scriptures. King Yama has had me sent back to the rich land of China to
be reborn in an important family. You must reward him generously, and no half measures. Now I'm going."
Indeed:
Great is the significance of the majestic Law,
That saves the dead from suffering and the morass.
When they all awoke from their dreams, the sun had already risen in the East. Boqin's wife said, "Warden,
your father came to me in a dream last night. He said that he had suffered long in the underworld, and couldn't
find deliverance. Now that the saintly monk has wiped out his sins by reading some scriptures, King Yama
has had him sent back to the rich land of China to be reborn in an important family. He told us to thank him
generously, and no half measures. When he'd said this he went out through the door and drifted away. He
didn't answer when I called, and I couldn't make him stay. Then I woke up and realized that it was a dream."
Journey to the West
Chapter 13 202
"I had a dream just like yours," replied Liu Boqin. "Let's go and tell mother about it." As they were on the
point of doing this they heard his mother shout, "Come here, Boqin my son. There's something I want to tell
you." The two of them went in to her to find the old woman sitting on the bed.
"My child, I had a happy dream last night. Your father came home and said that thanks to his salvation by the
venerable monk, his sins have been wiped out and he has gone to be reborn in an important family in the rich
land of China." Husband and wife laughed for joy and her son said, "I and my wife both had this dream, and
we were just coming to tell you when you called to us. So now it turns out that you it too." They told everyone
in the house to get up to thank Sanzang and get his horse loaded and ready. They all bowed to him and he
said, "Many thanks, venerable monk, for recommending my father for delivery from his sufferings and for
rebirth. We can never repay this debt of gratitude."
"What powers have I that you should thank me?" replied Sanzang.
Boqin told him about what the three of them had been told in their dreams, and Sanzang was happy too. Then
they gave him his breakfast and an ounce of silver as an expression of their thanks, but he would not take a
single penny of it, although the whole family begged and beseeched him to do so.
"If in your mercy you could escort me for the next stage of my journey I would be deeply touched," he said.
All that Boqin, his mother, and his wife could do then was to prepare some scones of coarse wheaten flour as
his provisions, and make sure that Boqin escorted him a long way. Sanzang gladly accepted the food. On his
mother's orders the high warden told two or three servants to bring hunting gear as they set off together along
the road. They saw no end of wild mountain scenery.
When they had been travelling for some time they saw a mountain in front of them, a high and precipitous one
that towered right up to the azure sky. Before long they had reached its base. The high warden climbed it as if
he were walking on level ground, and when they were half−way over it he turned round, stood beside the path
and said, "Venerable monk, I must ask you to take yourself on from here. I have to go back." On hearing this
Sanzang tumbled out of his saddle to say, "Please, please, take me another stage, High Warden."
"You don't seem to know that this is called Double Boundary Mountain," said the high warden. The Eastern
part belongs to our Great Tang, but the Western parts is Tatar territory. The tigers and wolves on that side are
not subject to my control, which is why I can't cross the boundary. You mast go on by yourself. The monk
was so alarmed to hear this that he waved his arms around and grabbed hold of the hunter's clothes and
sleeves, weeping and refusing to let him go. When at last Sanzang was bowing repeatedly to the hunter to take
his leave, a shout like thunder came from under the mountain: "My master's come, my master's come."
Sanzang stood frozen with fear at the sound of it, and Boqin had to hold him up. If you don't know who it was
who shouted, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 14
The Mind−Ape Returns to Truth
The Six Bandits Disappear Without Trace
Buddha is the mind, the mind is Buddha,
Mind and Buddha have always needed things.
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 203
When you know that there are no things and no mind
Then you are a Buddha with a true mind and a Dharma body.
A Dharma−bodied Buddha has no form;
A single divine light contains the ten thousand images.
The bodiless body is the true body.
The imageless image is the real image.
It is not material, not empty, and not non−empty;
It does not come or go, nor does it return.
It is not different nor the same, it neither is nor isn't.
It can't be thrown away or caught, nor seen or heard.
The inner and outer divine light are everywhere the same;
A Buddha−kingdom can be found in a grain of sand.
A grain of sand can hold a thousand worlds;
In a single body and mind, all dharmas are the same.
For wisdom, the secret of no−mind is essential,
To be unsullied and unobstructed is to be pure of karma.
When you do no good and do no evil,
You become a Kasyapa Buddha.
The terror−stricken Liu Boqin and Sanzang then heard another shout of "My master's come."
"That must be the old monkey who lives in a stone cell under this mountain shouting," said the servants.
"Yes, yes," said the high warden.
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 204
"What old monkey?" asked Sanzang, and the high warden replied, "This mountain used to be called Five
Elements Mountain, and its name was only changed to Double Boundary Mountain when our Great Tang
Emperor fought his Western campaign to pacify the country. I once heard an old man say that in the days
when Wang Mang usurped the Han throne, Heaven sent down this mountain and crushed a monkey under it.
This monkey doesn't mind heat or cold and neither eats nor drinks. He's guarded by a local tutelary god who
gives him iron pellets when he's hungry and molten copper when he's thirsty. Although he's been there since
ancient times, he hasn't died of cold or hunger. It must have been him shouting; there's nothing for you to be
afraid of, venerable sir. Let's go down and have a look." Sanzang had to follow him, leading his horse down
the mountain.
A mile or two later they saw that there really was a monkey poking out his head out of a stone cell, and
making desperate gestures with his outstretched hands as he shouted, "Master, why didn't you come before?
Thank goodness you're here, thank goodness. If you get me out of here I guarantee that you'll reach the
Western Heaven."
Do you know what the venerable monk saw when he went forward for a closer look?
A pointed mouth and sunken cheeks,
Fiery eyes with golden pupils.
His head was thick with moss,
And climbing figs grew from his ears.
By his temples grew little hair but a lot of grass,
Under his chin there was sedge instead of a beard.
Dirt between his eyebrows,
And mud on his nose
Made him an utter mess;
On his coarse fingers
And thick palms
Was filth in plenty.
He was so happy that he rolled his eyes
And made pleasant noises.
Although his tongue was nimble,
He couldn't move his body.
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 205
He was the Great Sage of five hundred years ago,
Who today could not escape the net of Heaven.
High warden Liu showed great courage in going up to him, pulling away the grass that was growing beside his
temples and the sedge under his chin, and asking, "What have you got to say?"
"I've got nothing to say," the monkey replied. "You just tell that monk to come over here while I ask him a
question."
"What question do you want to ask me?" said Sanzang.
"Are you the fellow sent to the Western Heaven by the Emperor of the East to fetch the scriptures?" asked the
monkey.
"Yes, I am," Sanzang replied. "Why do you ask?"
"I am the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who wrecked the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago. The Lord
Buddha put me under this mountain for my criminal insubordination. Some time ago the Bodhisattva Guanyin
went to the East on the Buddha's orders to find someone who could fetch the scriptures. When I asked her to
save me she told me that I was to give up evil−doing, return to the Buddha's Law, and do all I could to protect
the traveler when he went to the Western Paradise to worship Buddha and fetch the scriptures; she said that
there'll something in it for me when that's done. Ever since then I've been waiting day and night with eager
anticipation for you to come and save me, Master. I swear to protect you on your way to fetch the scriptures
and to be your disciple."
Sanzang, delighted to hear this, said, "Although you now have these splendid intentions and wish to become a
monk thanks to the teaching of the Bodhisattva, I've no axe or chisel, so how am I to get you out?"
"There's no need for axes or chisels. As long as you're willing to save me, I can get myself out," the monkey
replied.
"I'm willing to save you," Sanzang said, "but how are you going to get out?"
"On the top of this mountain there is a detention order by the Tathagata Buddha written in letters of gold. If
you climb the mountain and tear it off, I'll be straight out." Accepting his suggestion, Sanzang turned round to
ask Liu Boqin if he would go up the mountain with him.
"I don't know whether he's telling the truth or not," said Boqin, at which the monkey shouted at the top of his
voice, "It's true. I wouldn't dare lie about that."
So Liu Boqin told his servants to lead the horse while he helped Sanzang up the mountain. By hanging on to
creepers they managed to reach the summit, where they saw a myriad beams of golden light and a thousand
wisps of propitious vapour coming from a large, square rock on which was pasted a paper seal bearing the
golden words Om mani padme hum. Sanzang went up and knelt down before the rock, then read the golden
words and bowed his head to the ground a number of times.
He looked to the West and prayed, "I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the
scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to tear off the golden words and release the divine
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 206
monkey to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil
monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove it." When he had
prayed he bowed again, after which he went up and gently tore the paper seal off.
A scented wind blew in his face and carried the paper up into the sky as a voice called, "I am the Great Sage's
guard. Now that his sufferings are over I am going back to see the Tathagata and hand in this seal."
The startled Sanzang, Liu Boqin, and the rest of them all bowed to Heaven, then went down the mountain to
the stone cell, where they said to the monkey, "The restriction order has been torn off, so you can come out."
The delighted monkey said, "Master, please stand well clear so that I don't give you a fright when I come out."
On hearing this Liu Boqin took Sanzang and the rest of them to the East, and when they had covered some
two or three miles they heard the monkey shout, "Further, further!" So Sanzang went much further until he
was off the mountain. Then there was a great noise as the mountain split open.
As they were all shaking with terror, the monkey appeared kneeling stark naked in front of Sanzang's horse
and saying, "Master, I'm out." He bowed four times to Sanzang, then jumped up, addressed Liu Boqin with a
respectful noise, and said, "Thank you, elder brother, for escorting my master, and thank you too for weeding
the grass off my face." He then picked up the luggage and put it on the horse's back. At the sight of him the
horse felt so weak and trembling that it could not stay on its feet. Because the monkey had once been the
Protector of the Horses and looked after the dragon steeds of Heaven, and mortal horses were terrified at the
very sight of him.
Seeing that his intentions were indeed good and that he really was now a Buddhist, Sanzang asked him what
was his surname.
"My surname's Sun," replied the Monkey King.
"I'll give you a Buddhist name that I can call you by," said Sanzang.
"There's no need to trouble yourself," said the Monkey King, "I've already got one: Sun Wukong−−Monkey
Awakened to Emptiness."
"That's just right for our sect," exclaimed the monk. "As you look so much like a young novice, I'll give you
another name and call you Brother Monkey. Is that all right?"
"Yes, yes, yes," said Sun Wukong, and from then on he was also called Brother Monkey, or Sun the Novice.
When he saw that Brother Monkey was determined to go, the high warden turned to Sanzang, chanted a noise
of respect and said, "It's splendid that you have got so good a disciple, venerable sir. He'll certainly make the
journey. I must now take my leave."
Sanzang bowed to him in thanks, saying, "I have brought you a long way, and am deeply indebted to you.
When you return home please convey my respects to your venerable mother and your wife; I caused them a
lot of trouble, and hope that I shall be able to come and thank them on my return." Boqin returned his bow,
and with that they parted.
Brother Monkey asked Sanzang to mount the horse while he ambled ahead, stark naked, carrying the luggage
on his back. Before long they were over the Double Boundary Mountain.
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 207
Suddenly a ferocious tiger rushed at them, roaring and lashing about with its tail. Sanzang on his horse was
terrified. Brother Monkey, who was standing beside the path, put down the luggage and said happily, "Don't
be scared, master, it's just bringing me my clothes." He pulled a needle out of his ear and shook it in the wind,
turning it into an iron cudgel as thick as a bowl.
"I haven't used this little treasure in over five hundred years," he said, holding it in his hand. "Today I'm
bringing it out to get myself some clothes to wear."
Just watch as he rushes at the tiger, shouting, "Where d'you think you're going, wretch?" The tiger crouched in
the dust, not daring to move, as the cudgel smashed into its head.
Thousands of drops of red brain and many a pearly piece of tooth flew everywhere, so terrifying Sanzang that
he fell out of the saddle, biting on his finger and crying, "Heavens, the high warden had to fight for ages
before killing the striped tiger the other day, but this Sun Wukong has smashed a tiger to pull with a single
blow. He really is a tough's tough."
"Sit down for a moment, master, while I strip the clothes off him to wear on the journey," said Brother
Monkey as he dragged the tiger over.
"But he hasn't got any clothes," Sanzang protested.
"Don't bother yourself about it, I know how to cope." The splendid Monkey King pulled a hair from his body,
breathed some magic breath on it, and said "Change!," on which it turned into a pointed knife shaped like a
cow's ear. Cutting into the skin on the tiger's belly, he took it all off in a single stroke, chopped off the head
and claws, then held up the square hide to get an idea of its size.
"It's on the big side," he said, "so I could make two kilts out of it," and with these words he took his knife and
cut it in two. One piece he put away, and the other he wrapped round his waist to cover the lower half of his
body and tied firmly with a creeper he pulled down from beside the path.
"Let's go on, master, let's go on," he said. "The sewing can wait till we reach a house where we can borrow a
needle and thread." He pinched his iron cudgel to make it as small as a needle again, put it back in his ear,
took the luggage on his back, and asked Sanzang to mount the horse.
As the two of them went along the venerable monk asked from the horse's back, "Wukong, why has the iron
cudgel you used to kill the tiger disappeared?"
"What you don't know, master," replied Brother Monkey with a laugh, "is that I got it from the dragon palace
of the Eastern Sea, and that it's called the Magic Iron to Hold the Bed of the Milky Way in Place or
'As−You−Will Gold−Banded Cudgel'. When I raised my great rebellion against the Heavenly Palace in the
old days it served me well. It can change into anything and be whatever size I want it to be. Just now I turned
it into an embroidery needle and put it away in my ear. I only take it out when I need it."
Concealing his delight at hearing this, Sanzang went on to ask, "Why didn't that tiger move when it saw you?
Why on earth did it let you hit it?"
"I can tell you in all truthfulness, master, that not just tigers but even dragons have to be on their best behavior
when they meet me. I know a few tricks for putting them in their place and have the power to make rivers run
backwards and stir up the seas. I can tell what things are really like from appearances alone, and sort out the
truth behind what is said. When I want to make myself big I measure myself against the universe, and when I
shrink I can be held on a downy hair. There's no limit to the transformations I can perform, and nobody can
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 208
tell when I'm going to vanish or when I'm going to reappear. There was nothing wonderful about skinning that
tiger. Wait till I show you a thing or two." This took a great load off Sanzang's mind, and he whipped his
horse on. As master and disciple went along their way talking together, the sun was sinking in the West, and
they saw:
In the fiery glow of the setting sun
The clouds return to ends of the sky and the sea.
The birds on a thousand mountains chirrup and call,
Flying in flocks to the woods for the night.
The wild beasts go two by two;
All species return to their dens.
A crescent moon breaks through the dusk,
As countless points of starlight shimmer.
"You must hurry up, master, as it's late," said Monkey. "There must be a house in that clump of trees over
there, so let's get there as soon as possible to settle down for the night." Sanzang whipped on his horse and
galloped to the house, where he dismounted.
Brother Monkey put down the luggage, went up to the gate, and shouted, "Open up, open up." An old man
came out, leaning on a bamboo stick, and the gate creaked as he opened it. At the sight of Monkey's ugly face
and the tiger−skin wrapped around him, which made him look like the god of thunder, the old man was so
terrified that his legs turned to jelly and his body went numb.
"A devil.... A devil," he muttered deliriously.
Sanzang went up to support him, saying, "Don't be afraid, aged benefactor. He's no devil, he's my disciple."
When the old man looked up and saw Sanzang's pure face he felt steady on his feet at once, and he asked what
monastery Sanzang was from, and why had he brought that evil−looking creature to his house.
"I come from the Tang Court," said Sanzang, "and I am going to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and
ask for the scriptures. As we were passing this way at nightfall we came to your mansion, good benefactor, to
ask for a night's lodging. We shall be off before dawn tomorrow. I very much hope that you will be able to
help us."
"You may be a Tang man," the old fellow replied, "but that ugly brute certainly isn't."
"You've got no eyes in your head, you silly old man," shrieked Brother Monkey. "He's my master and I'm his
disciple. I'm no Tang man or Spike man, I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. Some of the people who live in
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 209
this house must know me, and I've seen you before."
"Where've you seen me?" the old man asked.
"Didn't you gather firewood in front of my face and pick wild vegetables from my cheeks when you were a
child?" said Sun Wukong.
"Rubbish," retorted the old man.
"Where did you live and where did I live when I was supposed to gather firewood and wild vegetables in front
of your face?"
"It's you who's talking rubbish, my child," replied Sun Wukong. "You don't know who I am, but I'm the Great
Sage from the stone cell under the Double Boundary Mountain. Take another look and see if you can
recognize me now." The old man at last realized who he was and said, "I suppose you do look a bit like him,
but however did you get out?" Sun Wukong told him the whole story of how the Bodhisattva had converted
him and told him to wait till the Tang Priest came to take off the seal and release him. The old man went
down on his knees and bowed his head, inviting the Tang Priest inside and calling his wife and children to
come and meet him; they were all very happy when they heard what had happened.
When they had drunk tea he asked Sun Wukong, "How old are you, Great Sage?"
"How old are you, then?" said Sun Wukong.
"In my senile way I have reached a hundred and thirty."
"Then you could be my remote descendant," said Brother Monkey. "I can't remember when I was born, but I
spent over five hundred years under that mountain."
"True, true," remarked the old man, "I remember my grandfather saying that this mountain fell from heaven to
crush a magical monkey, and you weren't able to get out before now. When I saw you in my childhood, grass
grew on your head and there was mud on your face, so I wasn't afraid of you. But now that the mud and grass
have gone you look thinner, and the tiger−skin round your waist makes you as near a devil as makes no
difference."
This conversation made everyone roar with laughter, and as he was a kind old man he had a vegetarian meal
set out. When the meal was over Sanzang asked him his surname.
"Chen," the old man replied. On hearing this, Sanzang raised his hands in greeting and said, "Venerable
benefactor, you are of the same clan as myself."
"Master," protested Brother Monkey, "You're called Tang, aren't you, so how can you belong to the same clan
as him?"
"My secular surname is Chen, and I am from Juxian Village, Hongnong Prefecture, Haizhou, in the Tang
Empire. My Buddhist name is Chen Xuanzang. But as our Great Tang Emperor Taizong called me his
younger brother and gave me the surname Tang, I am known as the Tang Priest." The old fellow was
delighted to hear that they shared a surname.
"Chen, old fellow," said Monkey, "I'm afraid this will be putting your family out, but I haven't washed for
over five hundred years, so could you go and boil up some water for me and my master to have a bath before
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 210
we set out again? Thank you." The old man gave instructions for water to be boiled and a tub brought, and he
lit the lamp.
When master and disciple had bathed they sat down by the lamp, and Brother Monkey asked once more, "Old
Chen, there's another thing I'd like to ask you: could you lend me a needle and thread?"
"Yes, of course," the old man replied, sending his wife to fetch them and then handing them to Monkey.
Monkey's sharp eyes had observed his master take off a short white cotton tunic, which he did not put on
again, so Monkey grabbed it and put it on himself. Then he took off his tiger skin, joined it up with a pleat,
wrapped it round his waist again, tied it with a creeper, went up to his master, and asked, "How would you say
these clothes compared with what I was wearing before?"
"Splendid, splendid," replied Sanzang, "it makes you look quite like a real monk. If you don't mind cast−offs,"
he added, "you can go on wearing that tunic." Sun Wukong chanted a "na−a−aw" of obedience and thanked
him, then went off to find some hay for the horse. When all the jobs were finished, master and disciple went to
bed.
Early the next morning Sun Wukong woke up and asked his master to set out. Sanzang dressed and told
Monkey to pack the bedding and the rest of the luggage. They were just on the point of leaving when the old
man appeared. He had prepared hot water for washing as well as breakfast. After breakfast they set out,
Sanzang riding the horse and Brother Monkey leading. They ate when they were hungry and drank when they
were thirsty, travelling by day and resting by night. Thus they went on until they realized it was early winter.
When the frost destroys the red leaves the woods are sparse;
On the ridge only pine and cypress flourish.
The unopened plum buds exhale a dark perfume,
Warming the short days,
A touch of spring.
When the chrysanthemum and lotus is finished, the wild tea blossoms.
By the cold bridge and the ancient trees the birds quarrel for branches.
In the twisting gully the waters of the spring run low,
Pale snow clouds drift across the sky.
The North wind blows strong,
Tugging at your−sleeves:
Who can bear the cold towards evening?
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 211
When master and disciple had been travelling for a long time they heard a whistle from beside the path, and
six men rushed out with spears, swords, cutlasses, and strongbows.
"Where do you think you're going, monk?" they roared. "If you give us your horse and luggage we'll spare
your life." Sanzang fell from his horse, scared out of his wits and unable to utter a word. Brother Monkey
helped him to his feet and said, "Don't worry, master, it's nothing serious. They're come to bring us some
clothes and our travelling expenses."
"Are you deaf, Wukong?" the other asked. "They told us to give them our horse and luggage, so how can you
ask them for clothes and money?"
"You look after the clothes, the luggage and the horse while I go and have a bash at them. We'll see what
happens."
"A good hand is no match for two fists," said Sanzang, "and a pair of fists is no match for four hands. They
are six big men against little you, all by yourself. You can't possibly have the nerve to fight them."
The brave Brother Monkey did not stop to argue. Instead he stepped forward, folded his arms across his chest,
bowed to the six bandits and said, "Why are you gentlemen obstructing our way?"
"We are mighty robber kings, benevolent lords of the mountain. We have been very famous for a long time,
although you don't seem to have heard of us. If you abandon your things at once, we'll let you go on your way;
but if there's even a hint of a 'no' from you, we'll turn your flesh into mincemeat and your bones into powder."
"I too am a hereditary robber king, and have ruled a mountain for many years, but I've never heard of you
gentlemen."
"Since you don't know our names, I'll tell them to you: Eye−seeing Happiness, Ear−hearing Anger,
Nose−smelling Love, Tongue−tasting Thought, Mind−born Desire, and Body−based Sorrow." Sun Wukong
laughed at them. "You're just a bunch of small−time crooks. You can't see that I'm your lord and master
although I'm a monk, and you have the effrontery to get in our way. Bring out all the jewels you've stolen, and
the seven of us can share them out equally. I'll let you off with that."
This made the bandits happy, angry, loving, thoughtful, desirous, and sorrowful respectively, and they all
charged him, yelling, "You've got a nerve, monk. You've got nothing to put in the kitty, but you want to share
our stuff." Waving their spears and swords they rushed him, hacking wildly at his face. Seventy or eighty
blows crashed down on him, but he simply stood in the middle of them, ignoring everything.
"What a monk!" the bandits said. "He's a real tough nut."
"I think we've seen enough of that," said Brother Monkey with a smile. "Your hands must be tired after all
that bashing. Now it's my turn to bring out my needle for a bit of fun."
"This monk must have been an acupuncturist," said the bandits. "There's nothing wrong with us. Why is he
talking about needles?"
Taking the embroidery needle from his ear, Brother Monkey shook it in the wind, at which it became an iron
cudgel as thick as a ricebowl. With this in his hand he said, "Stick around while I try my cudgel out." The
terrified bandits tried to flee in all directions, but Monkey raced after them, caught them all up, and killed
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 212
every one of them. Then he stripped the clothes off them, took their money, and went back with his face
wreathed in smiles.
"Let's go, master; I've wiped those bandits out," he said.
"Even though they were highwaymen, you're really asking for trouble," Sanzang replied. "Even if they had
been arrested and handed over to the authorities, they wouldn't have been sentenced to death. You may know
a few tricks, but it would be better if you'd simply driven them away. Why did you have to kill them all? Even
taking a man's life by accident is enough to stop someone from becoming a monk. A person who enters the
religious life
Spares the ants when he sweeps the floor,
Covers the lamps to save the moth.
What business did you have to slaughter the lot of them, without caring which of them were the guilty and
which were innocent? You haven't a shred of compassion or goodness in you. This time it happened in the
wilds, where nobody will be able to trace the crime. Say someone offended you in a city and you turned
murderous there. Say you killed and wounded people when you went berserk with that club of yours. I myself
would be involved even though I'm quite innocent."
"But if I hadn't killed them, they'd have killed you, master," protested Sun Wukong.
"I am a man of religion, and I would rather die than commit murder," said Sanzang. "If I'd died, there'd only
have been me dead, but you killed six of them, which was an absolute outrage. If the case were taken to court,
you couldn't talk your way out of this even if the judge were your own father."
"To tell you the truth, master, I don't know how many people I killed when I was the monster who ruled the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit," said Sun Wukong, "but if I'd acted your way I'd never have become the Great
Sage Equaling Heaven."
"It was precisely because you acted with such tyrannical cruelty among mortals and committed the most
desperate crimes against Heaven that you got into trouble five hundred years ago," retorted Sanzang. "But
now you have entered the faith, you'll never reach the Western Heaven and never become a monk if you don't
give up your taste for murder. You're too evil, too evil."
Monkey, who had never let himself be put upon, flared up at Sanzang's endless nagging.
"If you say that I'll never become a monk and won't ever reach the Western Heaven, then stop going on at me
like that. I'm going back."
Before Sanzang could reply, Monkey leapt up in a fury, shouting, "I'm off." Sanzang looked up quickly, but
he was already out of sight. All that could be heard was a whistling sound coming from the East. Left on his
own, the Priest nodded and sighed to himself with great sadness and indignation.
"The incorrigible wretch," he reflected. "Fancy disappearing and going back home like that just because I
gave him a bit of a telling−off. So that's that. I must be fated to have no disciples or followers. I couldn't find
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 213
him now even if I wanted to, and he wouldn't answer if I called him. I must be on my way." So he had to
strive with all his might to reach the West, looking after himself with nobody to help.
Sanzang had no choice but to gather up the luggage and tie it on the horse. He did not ride now. Instead,
holding his monastic staff in one hand and leading the horse by the reins with the other, he made his lonely
way to the West. Before he had been travelling for long he saw an old woman on the mountain path in front of
him. She was holding an embroidered robe, and a patterned hat was resting upon it. As she came towards him
he hurriedly pulled the horse to the side of the path to make room for her to pass.
"Where are you from, venerable monk," the old woman asked, "travelling all alone and by yourself?"
"I have been sent by the great King of the East to go to the West to visit the Buddha and ask him for the True
Scriptures," he replied.
"The Buddha of the West lives in the Great Thunder Monastery in the land of India, thirty−six thousand miles
away from here. You'll never get there, just you and your horse, without a companion or disciple."
"I did have a disciple, but his nature was so evil that he would not accept a little reproof I administered to him
and disappeared into the blue," said Sanzang.
"I have here an embroidered tunic and a hat inset with golden patterns that used to be my son's," the woman
said, "but he died after being a monk for only three days. I've just been to his monastery to mourn him and say
farewell to his master, and I was taking this tunic and this hat home to remember the boy by. But as you have
a disciple, venerable monk, I'll give them to you."
"Thank you very much for your great generosity, but as my disciple has already gone, I couldn't accept them."
"Where has he gone?"
"All I heard was a whistling sound as he went back to the East."
"My home isn't far to the East from here," she said, "so I expect he's gone there. I've also got a spell called
True Words to Calm the Mind, or the Band−tightening Spell. You must learn it in secret, and be sure to keep it
to yourself. Never leak it to anyone. I'll go and catch up with him and send him back to you, and you can give
him that tunic and hat to wear. If he's disobedient again, all you have to do is recite the spell quietly. That will
stop him committing any more murders or running away again."
Sanzang bowed low to thank her, at which she changed into a beam of golden light and returned to the East.
He realized in his heart that it must have been the Bodhisattva Guanyin who had given him the spell, so he
took a pinch of earth as if he were burning incense and bowed in worship to the East most reverently. Then he
put the tunic and hat in his pack, sat down beside the path, and recited the True Words to Calm the Mind over
and over again until he knew them thoroughly, and had committed them to his memory.
Let us turn to Sun Wukong, who after leaving his master went straight back to the Eastern Ocean on his
somersault cloud. Putting his cloud away, he parted the waters and went straight to the undersea palace of
crystal. His approach had alarmed the dragon king, who came out to welcome him and took him into the
palace, where they sat down.
When they had exchanged courtesies the dragon king said, "I'm sorry that I failed to come and congratulate
you on the end of your sufferings, Great Sage. I take it that you are returning to your old cave to put your
immortal mountain back in order."
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 214
"That's what I wanted to do," Monkey replied. "But I've become a monk instead."
"A monk? How?" the dragon king asked.
"The Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea converted me. She taught me to work for a good reward later by going
to the West with the Tang Priest from the East, visiting the Buddha, and becoming a monk. And my name has
been changed to Brother Monkey."
"Congratulations, congratulations," said the dragon king. "You've turned over a new leaf and decided to be
good. But in that case why have you come back to the East instead of going West?" Monkey laughed.
"Because that Tang Priest doesn't understand human nature. He started nagging away at me about a few
small−time highwaymen I killed, and said that everything about me was wrong. You know how I can't stand
people going on at me, so I left him to come home to my mountain. I looked in on you first to ask for a cup of
tea."
"Delighted to oblige," said the dragon king, and his dragon sons and grandsons came in with some fragrant tea
which they presented to Monkey.
When he had drunk his tea, Monkey looked round and saw a picture called, "Presenting the Shoe at the Yi
Bridge" hanging on the wall behind him.
"What's that a view of?" asked Monkey.
"You wouldn't know about it because it happened after your time," the dragon king replied. "It's called
'Presenting the Shoe Three Times at the Yi Bridge.'"
"What's all that about?" Monkey asked.
"The Immortal is Lord Yellow Stone, and the boy is Zhang Liang, who lived in Han times," the dragon king
replied. "Lord Yellow Stone was sitting on the bridge when suddenly he dropped one of his shoes under it and
told Zhang Liang to fetch it for him. The boy Zhang Liang did so at once, and knelt down to present it to him.
Lord Yellow Stone did this three times, and because Zhang Liang never showed a trace of arrogance or
disrespect, Lord Yellow Stone was touched by his diligence. One night he gave Zhang Liang some heavenly
books and told him to support the Han cause. Later he won victories hundreds of miles away through his
calculations within the walls of his tent. When peace came he resigned his office and went back to roam on
his mountain with Master Red Pine and achieve the Way of Immortality through enlightenment. Great Sage, if
you don't protect the Tang Priest with all your might, and if[O you reject his instruction, then you might as well
stop trying to win yourself a good later reward, because it will mean you're only an evil Immoral after all."
Monkey hummed and hawed, but said nothing.
"Great Sage," said the dragon king, "you must make your mind up. Don't ruin your future for the sake of any
easy life now."
"Enough said. I'll go back and look after him," replied Sun Wukong. The dragon king was delighted.
"In that case I shan't keep you. I ask you in your mercy not to leave your master waiting for long." Being thus
pressed to go, Monkey left the sea palace, mounted his cloud, and took leave of the dragon king.
On his way he met the Bodhisattva Guanyin. "What are you doing here, Sun Wukong?" she asked. "Why did
you reject the Tang Priest's teaching and stop protecting him?" Brother Monkey frantically bowed to her from
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 215
his cloud and replied, "As you had predicted, Bodhisattva, a monk came from the Tang Empire who took off
the seal, rescued me, and made me his disciple. I ran away from him because he thought I was wicked and
incorrigible, but now I'm going back to protect him."
"Hurry up then, and don't have any more wicked thoughts." With that they each went their separate ways.
A moment later Monkey saw the Tang Priest sitting gloomily beside the path. He went up to him and said,
"Why aren't you travelling, master? What are you still here for?" Sanzang looked up.
"Where have you been?" he asked. "I couldn't move without you, so I had to sit here and wait till you came
back."
"I went to visit the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea to ask him for some tea," Monkey replied.
"Disciple, a religious man shouldn't tell lies. How can you say that you went to drink tea at the dragon king's
place when you haven't been gone two hours?"
"I can tell you quite truthfully," replied Monkey with a smile, "that with my somersault cloud I can cover
thirty−six thousand miles in a single bound. That's how I got there and back."
"When I spoke to you a little severely you resented it and went off in a huff," said Sanzang. "It was all right
for a clever person like you−−you begged yourself some tea. But I couldn't go, and had to stay here hungry.
You ought to be sorry for me."
"If you're hungry, master, I'll go and beg you some food," suggested Monkey.
"No need," his master replied, "there are still some dry provisions in my bundle that the high warden's mother
gave me. Take that bowl and fetch some water. When we've eaten some of it we can be on our way."
Opening the bundle, Brother Monkey found some scones made of coarse flour, which he took out and gave to
his master. He also noticed the dazzling brocade tunic and the hat with inlaid golden patterns.
"Did you bring this tunic and hat with you from the East?" he asked. Sanzang had to make something up on
the spot.
"I used to wear them when I was young. With that hat on you can recite scriptures without ever having been
taught them, and if you wear that tunic you can perform the rituals without any practice."
"Dear master, please let me wear them," Monkey pleaded.
"I don't know whether they'll fit you, but if you can get them on, you can wear them." Monkey took off the old
white tunic, put the brocade one on instead, and found that it was a perfect fit. Then he put the hat on his head.
As soon as he had the hat on, Sanzang stopped eating and silently recited the Band−tightening Spell.
"My head aches, my head aches," cried Brother Monkey, but his master went on and recited the spell several
times more. Monkey, now rolling in agony, tore the hat to shreds, and Sanzang stopped reciting the spell for
fear he would break the golden band. The moment the spell stopped the pain finished. Reaching up to feel his
head, Monkey found something like a golden wire clamped so tightly around it that he could not wrench or
snap it off. It had already taken root there. He took the needle out of his ear, forced it inside the band, and
pulled wildly at it. Sanzang, again frightened that he would snap it, started to recite the spell once more. The
pain was so bad this time that Monkey stood on his head, turned somersaults, and went red in the face and
Journey to the West
Chapter 14 216
ears. His eyes were popping and his body went numb. Seeing the state he was in, Sanzang had to stop, and the
pain stopped again too.
"Master," said Monkey, "What a curse you put on me to give me a headache like that."
"I didn't put a curse on you, I recited the Band−tightening Spell," Sanzang replied.
"Say it again and see what happens," said Monkey, and when Sanzang did as he asked, Monkey's head ached
again. "Stop, stop," he shouted, "the moment you started reciting it my head ached. Why did you do it?"
"Will you accept my instruction now?" Sanzang asked.
"Yes," Monkey replied.
"Will you misbehave again in future?"
"I certainly won't," said Monkey.
Although he had made this verbal promise, he was still nurturing evil thoughts, and he shook his needle in the
wind till it was as thick as a ricebowl. He turned on the Tang Priest, and was on the point of finishing him off
when the terrified Sanzang recited the spell two or three more times.
The monkey dropped his cudgel and fell to the ground, unable to raise his arm, "Master," he shouted, "I've
seen the light. Stop saying the spell, please stop."
"How could you have the perfidy to try to kill me?" asked Sanzang.
"I'd never have dared," said Brother Monkey, adding, "who taught you that spell, master?"
"An old lady I met just now," replied Sanzang. Monkey exploded with rage.
"Tell me no more," he said, "I'm sure and certain the old woman was that Guanyin. How could she do this to
me? Just you wait. I'm going to the Southern Sea to kill her."
"As she taught me this spell," Sanzang replied, "she's bound to know it herself. If you go after her and she
recites it, that will be the end of you." Seeing the force of his argument, Monkey changed his mind and gave
up the idea of going. He knelt down and pleaded pitifully, "Master, she's used this to force me to go with you
to the West. I shan't go to make trouble for her, and you must recite scriptures instead of saying that spell all
the time. I promise to protect you, and I shall always be true to this vow."
"In that case you'd better help me back on the horse," Sanzang replied. Monkey, who had been plunged into
despair, summoned up his spirits, tightened the belt round his brocade tunic, got the horse ready, gathered up
the luggage, and hurried off towards the West. If you want to know what other stories there are about the
journey, then listen to the explanation in the next installment.

In the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge the Thought−Horse Is Reined in
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 217
Monkey looked after the Tang Priest as they headed West. They had been travelling for several days in the
twelfth month of the year, with its freezing North winds and biting cold. Their path wound along overhanging
precipices and steep cliffs, and they crossed range after range of dangerous mountains. One day Sanzang
heard the sound of water as he rode along, and he turned around to shout, "Monkey, where's that sound of
water coming from?"
"As I remember, this place is called Eagle's Sorrow Gorge in the Coiled Snake Mountain. It must be the water
in the gorge." Before he had finished speaking, the horse reached the edge of the gorge. Sanzang reined in and
looked. He saw:
A thin cold stream piercing the clouds,
Deep, clear waves shining red in the sun.
The sound shakes the night rain and is heard in the quiet valley,
Its color throws up a morning haze that obscures the sky.
A thousand fathoms of flying waves spit jade;
The torrent's roar howls in the fresh wind.
The current leads to the misty waves of the sea;
The egret and the cormorant never meet by a fisherman.
As master and disciple watched they heard a noise in the gorge as a dragon emerged from the waves, leapt up
the cliff, and grabbed at Sanzang. In his alarm Monkey dropped the luggage, lifted Sanzang off his horse,
turned, and fled. The dragon, unable to catch him up, swallowed the white horse, saddle and all, at a single
gulp, then disappeared once more beneath the surface of the water. Monkey made his master sit down on a
high peak and went back to fetch the horse and the luggage. When he found that the horse had gone and only
the luggage was left, he carried the luggage up to his master and put it down before him.
"Master," he said, "that damned dragon has disappeared without a trace. It gave our horse such a fright that it
ran away."
"However are we going to find the horse, disciple?"
"Don't worry, don't worry, wait here while I go and look for it."
He leapt into the sky, whistling. Putting up his hand to shade his fiery eyes with their golden pupils, he looked
all around below him, but saw no sign of the horse. He put his cloud away and reported, "Master, that horse of
ours must have been eaten by the dragon−−I can't see it anywhere."
"Disciple," Sanzang protested, "how could that wretched creature have a mouth big enough to swallow a horse
that size, saddle and all? I think the horse must have slipped its bridle in a panic and run into that valley. Go
and have a more careful look."
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 218
"You don't know about my powers," Monkey replied. "These eyes of mine can see what's happening three
hundred miles away, and within that range I can even spot a dragonfly spreading its wings. There's no way I
could miss a big horse like that."
"But we'll never get across those thousands of mountains and rivers." As he spoke, his tears fell like rain. The
sight of him crying was too much for Brother Monkey, who flared up and shouted, "Stop being such an
imbecile, master. Sit there and wait while I find that wretch and make him give us back our horse."
"You mustn't go," said Sanzang, grabbing hold of him. "I'm frightened that he'll come creeping out again and
kill me this time. Then I'll be dead as well as the horse, and that would be terrible."
This made Monkey angrier than ever, and he roared with a shout like thunder, "You're hopeless, absolutely
hopeless. You want a horse to ride but you won't let me go. This way you'll be sitting there looking at the
luggage for the rest of your life."
As he was yelling ferociously in a flaming temper, a voice was heard in the sky that said, "Don't be angry,
Great Sage; stop crying, younger brother of the Tang Emperor. We are gods sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin
to give hidden protection to the pilgrim who is fetching the scriptures."
At these words Sanzang immediately bowed, but Monkey said, "Tell me your names, you lot."
"We are the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions, the Four Duty Gods, and
the Eighteen Protectors of the Faith; we shall take it in turns to be in attendance every day."
"Who starts today?"
"The Dings and Jias, the Four Duty Gods, and the Protectors of the Faith will take turns. Of the Revealers of
the Five Regions, the Gold−headed Revealer will always be with you by day and by night."
"Very well then," said Monkey, "all those of you who are not on duty may withdraw. The Six Ding Heavenly
Generals, the Duty God of the Day, and the Revealers of the Truth will stay here to protect my master, while I
shall go to find that evil dragon in the gorge and make him give our horse back." The gods all did as they were
told, and Sanzang, now greatly relieved, sat on the cliff and gave Monkey detailed instructions.
"There's no need for you to worry," said the splendid Monkey King as he tightened the belt round his brocade
tunic, folded up his tiger−skin kilt, grasped his cudgel, went to the edge of the gorge, and stood amid clouds
and mist above the water. "Give us back our horse, mud loach, give us back our horse," he shouted.
Now when the dragon had eaten Sanzang's white horse it lay low in the stream, hiding its miraculous powers
and nourishing its vital nature. When it heard someone shouting and cursing it and demanding the horse back,
it was unable to hold back its temper.
Leaping up through the waves it asked, "How dare you make so free with your insults?"
The moment he saw it, Monkey roared, "Don't go! Give us back our horse!" and swung his cudgel at the
dragon's head. Baring its fangs and waving its claws, the dragon went for him. It was a noble battle that the
pair of them fought beside the ravine.
The dragon stretched its sharp claws,
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 219
The monkey raised his gold−banded cudgel.
The beard of one hung in threads of white jade,
The other's eyes flashed like golden lamps.
The pearls in the dragon's beard gave off a coloured mist,
The iron club in the other's hands danced like a whirlwind.
One was a wicked son who had wronged his parents;
The father, the evil spirit who had worsted heavenly generals.
Both had been through trouble and suffering,
And now they were to use their abilities to win merit.
Coming and going, fighting and resting, wheeling and turning, they battled on for a very long time until the
dragon's strength was exhausted and his muscles numb. Unable to resist any longer, it turned around, dived
into the water, and lay low at the bottom of the stream. It pretended to be deaf as the Monkey King cursed and
railed at it, and did not emerge again.
Monkey could do nothing, so he had to report to Sanzang, "Master, I swore at that ogre till it came out, and
after fighting me for ages it fled in terror. It's now in the water and won't come out again."
"Are you sure that it really ate our horse?" Sanzang asked.
"What a thing to say," said Monkey, "If it hadn't eaten the horse, it wouldn't have dared to say a word or fight
against me."
"When you killed that tiger the other day you said you had ways of making dragons and tigers submit to you,
so how comes it that you couldn't beat this one today?" Monkey had never been able to stand provocation, so
when Sanzang mocked him this time he showed something of his divine might.
"Say no more, say no more. I'll have another go at it and then we'll see who comes out on top."
The Monkey King leapt to the edge of the ravine, and used a magical way of throwing rivers and seas into
turmoil to make the clear waters at the bottom of the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge as turbulent as the waves of the
Yellow River in spate. The evil dragon's peace was disturbed as he lurked in the depths of the waters, and he
thought, "How true it is that blessings never come in pairs and troubles never come singly. Although I've been
accepting my fate here for less than a year since I escaped the death penalty for breaking the laws of Heaven, I
would have to run into this murderous devil."
The more he thought about it, the angrier he felt, and unable to bear the humiliation a moment longer he
jumped out of the stream cursing, "Where are you from, you bloody devil, coming here to push me around?"
"Never you mind where I'm from," Monkey replied. "I'll only spare your life if you give back that horse."
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 220
"That horse of yours is in my stomach, and I can't sick it up again, can I? I'm not giving it back, so what about
it?"
"If you won't give it back, then take this! I'm only killing you to make you pay for the horse's life." The two of
them began another bitter struggle under the mountain, and before many rounds were up the little dragon
could hold out no longer. With a shake of his body he turned himself into a water−snake and slithered into the
undergrowth.
The Monkey King chased it with his cudgel in his hands, but when he pushed the grass aside to find the snake
the three gods inside his body exploded, and smoke poured from his seven orifices. He uttered the magic word
om, thus calling out the local tutelary god and the god of the mountain, who both knelt before him and
reported their arrival.
"Put out your ankles," Monkey said, "while I give you five strokes each of my cudgel to work off my temper."
The two gods kowtowed and pleaded pitifully, "We beg the Great Sage to allow us petty gods to report."
"What have you got to say?" Monkey asked.
"We didn't know when you emerged after your long sufferings, Great Sage," they said, "which is why we
didn't come to meet you. We beg to be forgiven."
"In that case," Monkey said, "I won't beat you, but I'll ask you this instead: where does that devil dragon in the
Eagle's Sorrow Gorge come from, and why did he grab my master's white horse and eat it?"
"Great Sage, you never had a master," said the two gods, "and you were a supreme Immortal with an
undisturbed essence who would not submit to Heaven or Earth, so how does this master's horse come in?"
"You two don't know that either," Monkey replied. "Because of that business of offending against Heaven, I
had to suffer for five hundred years. Now I've been converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and she's sent a
priest who's come from the Tang Empire to rescue me. She told me to become his disciple and go to the
Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. As we were passing this way we lost my
master's white horse."
"Ah, so that's what's happening," the gods said. "There never used to be any evil creatures in the stream,
which ran wide and deep with water so pure that crows and magpies never dared to fly across it. This was
because they would mistake their own reflections in it for other birds of their own kind and often go
plummeting into the water. That's why it's called Eagle's Sorrow Gorge. Last year, when the Bodhisattva
Guanyin was on her way to find a man to fetch the scriptures, she rescued a jade dragon and sent it to wait
here for the pilgrim without getting up to any trouble. But when it's hungry it comes up on the bank to catch a
few birds or a roedeer to eat. We can't imagine how it could be so ignorant as to clash with the Great Sage."
"The first time he and I crossed swords we whirled around for a few rounds," Brother Monkey replied. "The
second time I swore at him but he wouldn't come out, so I stirred up his stream with a spell to throw rivers and
seas into turmoil, after which he came out and wanted to have another go at me. He didn't realize how heavy
my cudgel was, and he couldn't parry it, so he changed himself into a water snake and slithered into the
undergrowth. I chased him and searched for him, but he's vanished without a trace."
"Great Sage, you may not be aware that there are thousands of interconnected tunnels in this ravine, which is
why the waters here run so deep. There is also a tunnel entrance round here that he could have slipped into.
There's no need for you to be angry, Great Sage, or to search for it. If you want to catch the creature, all you
have to do is to ask Guanyin to come here, and it will naturally submit."

Chapter 15 221
On receiving this suggestion Monkey told the local deity and the mountain god to come with him to see
Sanzang and tell him all about what had happened previously. "If you go to ask the Bodhisattva to come here,
when will you ever be back?" he asked, adding, "I'm terribly cold and hungry."
Before the words were out of his mouth they heard the voice of the Gold−headed Revealer shouting from the
sky, "Great Sage, there's no need for you to move. I'll go and ask the Bodhisattva to come here." Monkey,
who was delighted, replied, "This is putting you to great trouble, but please be as quick as you can." The
Revealer then shot off on his cloud to the Southern Sea. Monkey told the mountain god and the local deity to
protect his master, and sent the Duty God of the Day to find some vegetarian food, while he himself patrolled
the edge of the ravine.
The moment the Gold−headed Revealer mounted his cloud he reached the Southern Sea. Putting away his
propitious glow, he went straight to the Purple Bamboo Grove on the island of Potaraka, where he asked the
Golden Armour Devas and Moksa to get him an audience with the Bodhisattva.
"What have you come for?" the Bodhisattva asked.
"The Tang Priest," the Revealer replied, "has lost his horse in the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge, and the Great Sage
Sun Wukong is desperate, because they can neither go forward nor back. When the Great Sage asked the local
deity he was told that the evil dragon you sent to the ravine, Bodhisattva, had swallowed it, so he has sent me
to ask you to subdue this dragon and make it give back the horse."
"That wretched creature was the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, whom his father
reported for disobedience when he burned the palace jewels. The heavenly court condemned him to death for
it, but I went myself to see the Jade Emperor and asked him to send the dragon down to serve the Tang Priest
as a beast of burden. Whatever made it actually eat the Tang Priest's horse? I'd better go and look into it." The
Bodhisattva descended from her lotus throne, left her magic cave, and crossed the Southern Sea, travelling on
propitious light with the Revealer. There is a poem about it that goes:
Honey is in the Buddha's words that fill Three Stores of scripture,
The Bodhisattva's goodness is longer than the Great Wall.
The wonderful words of the Mahayana fill Heaven and Earth,
The truth of the prajna rescues ghosts and souls.
It even made the Golden Cicada shed his cocoon once more,
And ordered Xuanzang to continue cultivating his conduct.
Because the road was difficult at the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge,
The dragon's son returned to the truth and changed into a horse.
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 222
The Bodhisattva and the Revealer reached the Coiled Snake Mountain before long, and stopping their cloud in
mid−air they looked down and saw Brother Monkey cursing and shouting at the edge of the ravine. When the
Bodhisattva told him to call Monkey over, the Revealer brought his cloud to land at the edge of the ravine.
Instead of going to see Sanzang first, he said to Monkey, "The Bodhisattva's here."
Monkey leapt straight into the air on his cloud and shouted at her at the top of his voice, "Teacher of the
Seven Buddhas, merciful head of our religion, why did you think up this way of hurting me?"
"I'll get you, you outrageous baboon, you red−bottomed ape," she replied. "I was at my wit's end two or three
times over how to fetch that pilgrim, and I told him to save your life. But far from coming to thank me for
saving you, you now have the effrontery to bawl at me."
"You've been very good to me, I must say," retorted Monkey. "If you'd let me out to roam around enjoying
myself as I pleased, that would have been fine. I was all right when you met me above the sea the other day,
spoke a few unkind words, and told me to do all I could to help the Tang Priest. But why did you give him
that hat he tricked me into wearing to torture me with? Why did you make this band grow into my head? Why
did you teach him that Band−tightening Spell? Why did you make that old monk recite it over and over again
so that my head ached and ached? You must be wanting to do me in." The Bodhisattva smiled.
"You monkey. You don't obey the commands of the faith, and you won't accept the true reward, so if you
weren't under control like this you might rebel against Heaven again or get up to any kind of evil. If you got
yourself into trouble as you did before, who would look after you? Without this monstrous head, you'd never
be willing to enter our Yogacatin faith."
"Very well then," Monkey replied, "let's call this object my monstrous head. But why did you send that
criminal and evil dragon to become a monster here and eat my master's horse? Letting evil creatures out to run
amuck like that is a bad deed."
"I personally asked the Jade Emperor to put the dragon here as a mount for the pilgrim," said the Bodhisattva.
"Do you think an ordinary horse would be able to cross the thousands of mountains and rivers to reach the
Buddha−land on the Vulture Peak? Only a dragon horse will be able to do it."
"But he's so afraid of me that he's skulking down there and won't come out, so what's to be done?" Monkey
asked.
The Bodhisattva told the Revealer to go to the edge of the ravine and shout, "Come out, Prince Jade Dragon,
son of the Dragon King Ao Run, to see the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea," after which the offspring would
emerge. The Revealer went to the edge of the gorge and shouted this twice, immediately the young dragon
leapt up through the waves, took human form, stepped on a cloud, and greeted the Bodhisattva in mid−air.
"In my gratitude to you, Bodhisattva, for saving my life, I have been waiting here for a long time, but I have
had no news yet of the pilgrim who is going to fetch the scriptures." The Bodhisattva pointed to Brother
Monkey and said, "Isn't he the pilgrim's great disciple?"
"He's my enemy," the young dragon replied when he looked at him. "I ate his horse yesterday because I was
starving, so he used some powers of his to fight me till I returned exhausted and terrified, then swore at me so
that I had to shut myself in, too frightened to come out. He never said a word about anyone fetching
scriptures."
"You never asked me my name, so how could I have told you?" Monkey retorted.
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 223
"I asked you 'Where are you from, you bloody devil?' and you yelled, 'Never mind where I'm from, and give
me back that horse.' You never so much as breathed the word 'Tang.'"
"You monkey, you are so proud of your own strength that you never have a good word for anyone else," said
the Bodhisattva.
"There will be others who join you later on your journey, and when they ask you any questions, the first thing
you must mention is fetching the scriptures. If you do that, you'll have their help without any trouble at all."
Monkey was happy to accept instruction from her. The Bodhisattva then went forward, broke off some of the
pearls from the dragon's head, soaked the end of her willow twig in the sweet dew in her bottle, sprinkled it on
the dragon's body, and breathed on it with magic breath, shouted, and the dragon turned into the exact likeness
of the original horse.
"You must concentrate on wiping out your past sins," she told him, "and when you have succeeded, you will
rise above ordinary dragons and be given back your golden body as a reward." The young dragon took the bit
between his teeth, and her words to heart. The Bodhisattva told Sun Wukong to take him to see Sanzang as
she was returning to the Southern Sea. Monkey clung to her, refusing to let her go.
"I'm not going," he said, "I'm not going. If the journey to the West is as tough as this, I can't possibly keep this
mortal priest safe, and if there are many such more trials and tribulations, I'll have enough trouble keeping
alive myself. How can I ever achieve any reward? I'm not going, I'm not going."
"In the old days, before you had learned to be a human being," the Bodhisattva replied, "you were prepared to
work for your awakening with all your power. But now that you have been delivered from a Heaven−sent
calamity, you have grown lazy. What's the matter with you? In our faith, to achieve nirvana you must believe
in good rewards. If you meet with injury or suffering in future, you have only to call on Heaven and Earth for
them to respond; and if you get into a really hopeless situation I shall come to rescue you myself. Come over
here as I have another power to give you."
The Bodhisattva plucked three leaves from her willow twig, put them on the back of Brother Monkey's head,
and shouted "Change," on which they turned into three life−saving hairs. "When the time comes and nobody
else will help you," she said, "they will turn into whatever is needed to save you from disaster."
After hearing all these fine words, Monkey finally took his leave of the All−merciful Bodhisattva, who went
back to Potaraka amidst scented breezes and coloured mists.
Monkey brought his cloud down to land, and led the dragon horse by the mane to see Sanzang. "Master," he
said, "we've got our horse." Sanzang cheered up the moment he saw it.
"Why is it sturdier than it was before?" he asked. "Where did you find it?"
"Master, you must have been dreaming. The Golden−headed Revealer asked the Bodhisattva to come here,
and she turned the dragon in the gorge into our white horse. The coloring is the same, but it hasn't got a saddle
or a bridle, which is why I had to drag it here." Sanzang was astounded.
"Where's the Bodhisattva? I must go and worship her," he said.
"She's back in the Southern Sea by now, so don't bother," Monkey replied. Sanzang took a pinch of earth as if
he were burning incense, knelt down, and bowed to the South. When he had finished he got up and helped
Monkey put their things together for the journey. Monkey dismissed the mountain god and the local deity,
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 224
gave orders to the Revealer and the Duty Gods, and invited his master to mount the horse.
"I couldn't possibly ride it−−it's got no saddle or bridle," his master replied, "but we can sort this out when
we've found a boat to ferry us across the stream."
"Master, you seem to have no common sense at all. Where will a boat be found in these wild mountains? This
horse has lived here for a long time and is bound to know about the currents, so you can ride him and use him
as your boat." Sanzang had no choice but to do as Monkey suggested and ride the horse bareback to the edge
of the stream while Monkey carried the luggage.
An aged fisherman appeared upstream, punting a raft along with the current. As soon as he saw him, Monkey
waved his hand and shouted, "Come here, fisherman, come here. We're from the East, and we're going to
fetch the scriptures. My master is having some trouble crossing the river, so come and ferry him over."
The fisherman punted towards them with all speed, while Monkey asked Sanzang to dismount and helped him
on board the raft. Then he led the horse on and loaded the luggage, after which the fisherman pushed off and
started punting with the speed of an arrow. Before they realized it they had crossed the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge
and were on the Western bank.
When Sanzang told Brother Monkey to open the bundle and find a few Great Tang coins and notes to give the
fisherman, the old man pushed his raft off from the shore with the words, "I don't want your money, I don't
want your money," and drifted off into mid−stream. Sanzang was most upset, but could do nothing except put
his hands together and thank him.
"There's no need to thank him, master," Monkey said. "Can't you see who he is? He's the water god of this
stream, and I should be giving him a beating for not coming to welcome me. He should consider himself
lucky to get off the beating−−how could he possibly expect money too?" His master, who was only
half−convinced, mounted the saddleless horse once more and followed Monkey to join the main path, and
then they hurried on towards the West. Indeed:
The great truth landed on the opposite bank,
The sincere heart and complete nature climbed Vulture Peak.
As disciple and master went forward together, the sun slipped down in the West and evening drew in.
Pale and ragged clouds,
The moon dim over the mountains,
As the cold frost fills the heavens,
And the wind's howl cuts through the body.
With the lone bird gone, the grey island seems vast;
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 225
Where the sunset glows, the distant mountains are low.
In the sparse forests a thousand trees moan,
On the deserted peak a lonely ape screams.
The path is long, and bears no footprints,
As the boat sails thousands of miles into the night.
As Sanzang was gazing into the distance from the back of his horse, he noticed a farm−house beside the path.
"Monkey," he said, "let's spend the night in the house ahead of us and go on in the morning."
Monkey looked up and replied, "Master, it's not a farm−house."
"Why not?"
"A farm−house wouldn't have all those decorative fishes and animals on the roof. It must be a temple or a
nunnery."
As they were talking they reached the gate, and when Sanzang dismounted he saw the words TEMPLE OF
THE WARD ALTAR written large above the gate and went inside.
Here an old man with a rosary of pearls hanging round his neck came out to meet them with his hands held
together and the words, "Please sit down, master." Sanzang quickly returned his courtesies and entered the
main building to pay his respects to the divine image. The old man told a servant to bring tea, and when that
had been drunk Sanzang asked the old man why the temple was dedicated to the ward altar.
"This place is in the territory of the Western land of Kami," the old man replied, "and behind the temple lives
the devout farm family which built it. 'Ward' means the ward of a village, and the altar is the altar of the local
tutelary deity. At the time of the spring ploughing, the summer weeding, the autumn harvest, and the storing
away in winter they all bring meat, flowers, and fruit to sacrifice to the altar. They do this to ensure good
fortune throughout the four seasons, a rich crop of the five grains, and good health for the six kinds of
livestock."
On hearing this Sanzang nodded and said in approval, "How true it is that 'Go three miles from home, and
you're in another land.' We have nothing as good as this in our country." The old man then asked him where
his home was.
"I come from the land of the Great Tang in the East," Sanzang replied, "and I have imperial orders to go to the
Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. As our journey brought us this way and it
is almost night, we have come to this holy temple to ask for a night's lodging. We shall set off at dawn." The
old man, who was very pleased to hear this, apologized profusely for having failed in his hospitality and told
the servant to prepare a meal. When Sanzang had eaten he thanked the old man.
Monkey's sharp eyes had noticed a clothes−line under the eaves of the building. He went over, tore it down,
and hobbled the horse with it. "Where did you steal that horse from?" the old man asked with a smile.
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 226
"You don't know what you're talking about," Monkey replied. "We're holy monks going to visit the Buddha,
so how could we possibly steal a horse."
"If you didn't steal it," the old man continued, the smile still on his lips, "then why do you have to break my
clothes−line because it's got no saddle, bridle or reins?"
Sanzang apologized for Monkey and said to him, "You're too impatient, you naughty monkey. You could
have asked the old gentleman for a piece of rope to tether the horse with. There was no need to snap his
clothes−line. Please don't be suspicious, sir," Sanzang went on, addressing the old man. "This horse isn't
stolen, I can assure you. When we reached the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge yesterday I was riding a white horse
complete with saddle and bridle. We did not know that there was an evil dragon in the stream who had
become a spirit, and this dragon swallowed my horse saddle, bridle and all, in a single gulp. Luckily this
disciple of mine has certain powers, and he brought the Bodhisattva Guanyin to the side of the gorge, where
she caught the dragon and changed it into a white horse, exactly like the original one, to carry me to the
Western Heaven to visit the Buddha. It's been less than a day from when we crossed that stream to when we
reached your holy shrine, sir, and we haven't yet saddle or bridle for it."
"Please don't be angry, Father. I was only joking," the old man replied. "I never thought your respected
disciple would take it seriously. When I was young I had a bit of money, and I was fond of riding a good
horse, but many years of troubles and bereavement have taken the fire out of me, and I've come to this
miserable end as a sacristan looking after the incense. Luckily the benefactor who owns the farm behind here
provides me with the necessities of life. As it happens, I still have a saddle and bridle−−I was so fond of them
in the old days that I have never been able to bring myself to sell them, poor as I am. Now that I have heard,
venerable master, how the Bodhisattva saved the divine dragon and changed it into a horse to carry you, I feel
that I must help too, so I shall bring that saddle and bridle out tomorrow for you to ride on. I beg you to be
gracious enough to accept them."
Sanzang thanked him effusively. The servant boy had by now produced the evening meal, and when it was
over they spread out their bedding, lamp in hand, and all went to sleep.
When Monkey got up the next morning he said, "Master, that old sacristan promised us the saddle and bridle
last night. You must insist and not let him off." Before the words were out of his mouth, the old man appeared
with the saddle and bridle in his hands, as well as saddle−cloth, saddle−pad, reins, muzzle and all the other
trappings for a horse. Nothing was missing.
As he put it all down in front of the verandah he said, "Master, I humbly offer this saddle and bridle." When
Sanzang saw them he accepted them with delight. Then he told Monkey to put them on the horse to see if they
fitted him. Monkey went over and picked them up to look at them one by one: they were all fine pieces. There
are some verses to prove it that go
The well−carved saddle shines with silver stars
The jeweled stirrups gleam with golden light.
Several layers of saddle−pads are made from wool,
The lead−rope is plaited from purple silk.
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 227
The reins are inlaid with flashing flowers,
The blinkers have dancing animals outlined in gold.
The bit is made of tempered steel,
And woollen tassels hang from either end.
Monkey, who was secretly very pleased, put the saddle and bridle on the horse and found that they fitted as if
they had been made to measure. Sanzang knelt and bowed to the old man in thanks, at which the old man
rushed forward and said, "No, no, how could I allow you to thank me?" The old man did not try to keep them
a moment longer, and bade Sanzang mount the horse. When he was out of the gate Sanzang climbed into the
saddle, while Monkey carried the luggage. The old man then produced a whip from his sleeve and offered it to
Sanzang as he stood beside the road. Its handle was of rattan bound with leather, and its thong of tiger sinew
bound at the end with silk.
"Holy monk," he said, "I would also like to give you this as you leave." As Sanzang took it sitting on
horseback, he thanked the old man for his generosity.
As Sanzang was on the point of clasping his hands together to take his leave of him, the old man disappeared,
and on turning round to look at the temple, the monk could see nothing but a stretch of empty land. He heard a
voice saying in the sky, "Holy monk, we have been very abrupt with you. We are the mountain god and the
local deity of Potaraka Island, and we were sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin to give you the saddle and bridle.
You two are now to make for the West as fast as you can, and not to slacken your pace for a moment."
Sanzang tumbled out of the saddle in a panic, and worshipped the heavens, saying, "My eyes of flesh and my
mortal body prevented me from recognizing you, noble gods; forgive me, I beg you. Please convey my
gratitude to the Bodhisattva for her mercy." Look at him, kowtowing to the sky more often than you could
count. The Great Sage Sun Wukong, the Handsome Monkey King, was standing by the path overcome with
laughter and beside himself with amusement. He went over and tugged at the Tang Priest.
"Master," he said, "get up. They're already much too far away to hear your prayers or see your kowtows, so
why ever are you doing that?"
"Disciple," Sanzang replied, "what do you mean by standing beside the path sneering at me and not even
making a single bow while I've done all those kowtows?"
"You don't know anything," Monkey retorted. "A deceitful pair like that deserve a thrashing. I let them off out
of respect for the Bodhisattva. That's quite enough: they couldn't expect me to bow to them too, could they?
I've been a tough guy since I was a kid, and I don't bow to anyone. Even when I meet the Jade Emperor or the
Supreme Lord Lao Zi I just chant a 'na−a−aw' and that's all."
"You inhuman beast," said Sanzang, "stop talking such nonsense. Get moving, and don't hold us up a moment
longer." With that Sanzang rose to his feet and they set off to the West.
The next two months' journey was peaceful, and they only met Luoluos, Huihuis, wolves, monsters, tigers,
and leopards. The time passed quickly, and it was now early spring. They saw mountains and forests clad in
emerald brocade as plants and trees put out shoots of green; and when all the plum blossom had fallen, the
willows started coming into leaf. Master and disciple traveled along enjoying the beauties of spring, and they
Journey to the West
Chapter 15 228
saw that the sun was setting in the West. Sanzang reined in his horse to look into the distance, and in the fold
of a mountain he dimly discerned towers and halls.
"Wukong," he said, "can you see if there's anywhere we can go there?" Monkey looked and said, "It must be a
temple or a monastery. Let's get there quickly and spend the night there." Sanzang willingly agreed, and
giving his dragon horse a free rein he galloped towards it. If you don't know what sort of place it was that they
were going to, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 16
The Monks of the Guanyin Monastery Plot to Take the Treasure
The Monster of the Black Wind Mountain Steals the Cassock
The master whipped on his horse and hurried straight to the temple gate with his disciple to have a look. They
saw that it was indeed a monastery:
Hall upon hall,
Cloister after cloister.
Beyond the triple gates
Countless coloured clouds are massed;
Before the Hall of Five Blessings
Coil a thousand wisps of red mist.
Two rows of pine and bamboo,
A forest of locust and cypress trees.
The two rows of pine and bamboo
Are ageless in their elegant purity;
The forest of locust and cypress trees
Has color and beauty.
See how high the drum and bell towers are,
How tall the pagoda.
In peaceful mediation the monks make firm their natures,
As birds sing in the trees outside.
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 229
Peace beyond mortal dust is the only true peace;
Emptiness with the Way is the real emptiness.
As the poem goes,
A supreme Jetavana hidden in a green valley,
A monastery set in scenery unbeaten in the world.
Such pure lands are rare on earth;
On most of the famous mountains dwell monks.
Sanzang dismounted, Monkey laid down his burden, and they were just on the point of going in when a crowd
of monks came out. This is how they were dressed:
On their heads they wore hats pinned on the left,
On their bodies were clothes of purity.
Copper rings hung from their ears,
And silken belts were tied around their waists.
Slowly they walked on sandals of straw,
As they held wooden clappers in their hands.
With their mouths they were always chanting
Their devotion to the Wisdom.
When Sanzang saw them he stood respectfully beside the gate and greeted them. A monk hastily returned his
greeting and apologized for not noticing them before.
"Where are you from?" he asked, "please come to the abbot's rooms and have some tea."
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 230
"I have been sent from the East on an imperial mission to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and
ask for the scriptures," Sanzang replied, "and as it is almost night we would like to ask for a night's lodging
now that we are here."
"Come inside and sit down, come inside and sit down," the monk said. When Sanzang told Monkey to lead
the horse over, the monk was frightened at the sudden sight of him and asked, "What's that thing leading the
horse?"
"Keep your voice down," Sanzang urged, "keep your voice down. He has a quick temper, and if he hears you
referring to him as 'that thing,' he'll be furious. He's my disciple."
The monk shuddered and bit his finger as he remarked, "Fancy taking a monstrously ugly creature like that for
a disciple."
"He may not look it," Sanzang replied, "but ugly as he is, he has his uses."
The monk had no choice but to go through the monastery gate with Sanzang and Monkey, and inside they saw
the words CHAN MONASTERY OF GUANYIN written in large letters on the main hall. Sanzang was
delighted.
"I have often been the grateful beneficiary of the Bodhisattva's divine mercy," he exclaimed, "but I have not
yet been able to kowtow to her in thanks. To worship her in this monastery will be just as good as seeing her
in person." On hearing this, the monk, ordering a lay brother to open the doors, invited Sanzang to go in and
worship. Monkey tethered the horse, put the luggage down, and went up into the hall with Sanzang, who
prostrated himself and put his head on the floor before the golden statue. When the monk went to beat the
drum, Monkey started striking the bell. Sanzang lay before the image, praying with all his heart, and when he
had finished the monk stopped beating the drum. Monkey, however, was so engrossed in striking the bell,
sometimes fast and sometimes slow, that he went on for a very long time.
"He's finished his devotions," a lay brother said, "so what are you still beating the bell for?"
Monkey threw down the bell hammer and said with a grin, "You're ignorant, aren't you? 'Whoever is a monk
for a day strikes the bell for a day': that's me." By then all the monks in the monastery, senior and junior, as
well as the abbot and his assistant, had been so startled by the wild noises from the bell that they all came
crowding out to ask what savage was making such a din with the bell and drum. Monkey jumped out and
cursed them: "Your grandfather Sun Wukong was having some fun."
All the monks collapsed with shock at the sight of him and said as they knelt on the ground, "Lord Thunder
God, Lord Thunder God."
"The Thunder God is my great grandson," Monkey replied. "Get up, get up, you've nothing to fear. I'm a lord
from the land of the Great Tang empire in the East." The monks all bowed to him, and could not feel easy
until Sanzang appeared.
"Please come and drink tea in my rooms," said the abbot of the monastery. The horse was unloaded and led
off, while they went round the main hall to a room at the back where they sat down according to their
seniority.
The abbot gave them tea and arranged for food to be brought, and after the meal it was still early. As Sanzang
was expressing his thanks, two servant boys appeared behind them supporting an aged monk. This is what he
looked like:
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 231
A Vairocana miter on his head
Topped with a gleaming cat's−eye jewel.
On his body a gown of brocade,
Edged with gold−mounted kingfisher feathers.
A pair of monkish shoes studded with the Eight Treasures,
A walking stick inlaid with Clouds and stars.
A face covered with wrinkles,
Like the Old Goddess of Mount Li;
A pair of purblind eyes,
Like the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea.
His mouth can't keep out the wind as his teeth have gone;
His back is bent because his muscles are stiff.
"The Patriarch has come," the monks all said. Sanzang bowed low to him in greeting and said, "Your disciple
pays his respects, venerable abbot." The aged monk returned his greeting and they both sat down.
"The youngsters have just told me that gentlemen have come from the Tang Empire in the East," he said, "so I
have come out to see you."
"Please forgive us for blundering into your monastery so rudely," Sanzang replied.
"Don't put it like that," the aged monk said, going on to ask, "How long a journey is it from the Eastern lands
to here?"
"It was over sixteen hundred miles from Chang'an to the Double Boundary Mountain, where I took on this
disciple," Sanzang replied. "We traveled on together through the land of Kami, and as that took two months
we must have covered getting on for another two thousand miles before reaching here."
"Over three thousand miles," said the aged monk. "I have spent a life of piety and have never been outside the
monastery gates, so you could really say that I have been 'looking at heaven from the bottom of a well,' and
call mine a wasted life."
"How great is your age, venerable abbot?" Sanzang asked.
"In my stupid way I have lived to be two hundred and seventy," the old monk replied.
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 232
"Then you're my ten−thousandth−great grandson," put in Monkey.
"Talk properly," said Sanzang, glaring at him, "Don't be so disrespectful and rude."
"How old are you, sir?" the aged monk asked.
"I don't venture to mention it," Monkey replied. The aged monk then thought that he must have been raving,
so he put the matter out of his mind, said no more about it, and ordered tea to be brought for them. A young
page brought in three cloisonne teacups on a jade tray the color of mutton fat, and another carried in a white
alloy teapot from which he poured out three cups of fragrant tea. It had a better color than pomegranate
blossom, and its aroma was finer than cassia. When Sanzang saw all this he was full of praise.
"What splendid things," he said, "what splendid things. Wonderful tea in wonderful vessels."
"They're not worth looking at," the old monk replied. "After all, sir, you come from a superior and heavenly
court, and have seen many rare things in your wide travels; so how can you give such exaggerated praise to
things like that? What treasures did you bring with you from your superior country that I could have a look
at?"
"I'm afraid our Eastern land has no great treasures, and even if it did, I would have been unable to bring them
on so long a journey."
"Master," put in Monkey, who was sitting beside him, "isn't that cassock I saw in our bundle the other day a
treasure? Why don't I take it out for him to see?" When the monks heard him mention the cassock, they
smiled sinister smiles.
"What are you smiling at?" Monkey asked.
"We thought it was very funny when you said that a cassock was a treasure," the abbot of the monastery
replied. "A priest of my rank has two or three dozen, and our Patriarch, who has been a monk here for two
hundred and fifty or sixty years, has seven or eight hundred." He ordered them to be brought out and
displayed. The old monk, who was also in on the game, told the lay brothers to open the store−rooms, while
friars carried twelve chests out into the courtyard, and unlocked them. Then they set up clothes frames, put
rope all around, shook the cassocks open one by one, and hung them up for Sanzang to see. Indeed, the whole
building was full of brocade, and the four walls covered with silk.
Monkey examined them one by one and saw that some were made of brocade and some were embroidered
with gold.
"Enough, enough, enough," he said. "Put them away, put them away. I'll bring ours out for you to take a look
at."
Sanzang drew Monkey aside and whispered to him, "Disciple, never try to compete with other people's
wealth, you and I are alone in this foreign land, and I'm afraid that there may be trouble."
"What trouble can come from letting him look at the cassock?" Monkey asked.
"You don't understand," Sanzang replied. "The ancients used to say, 'Don't let greedy and treacherous men see
rare or amusing things.' If he lays his eyes on it, his mind will be disturbed, and if his mind is disturbed, he's
bound to start scheming. If you were cautious, you would only have let him see it if he'd insisted; but as it is,
this is no trifling matter, and may well be the end of us."
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 233
"Don't worry, don't worry," said Brother Monkey, "I'll look after everything." Watch as without another word
of argument he rushes off and opens the bundle, which is already giving off a radiant glow. It still had two
layers of oiled paper round it, and when he removed it to take out the cassock and shake it open the hall was
bathed in red light and clouds of coloured vapours filled the courtyard. When the monks saw it their hearts
were filled with delight and their mouths with praise. It really was a fine cassock.
Hung with pearls of unrivalled quality,
Studded with Buddhist treasures infinitely rare.
Above and below a dragon beard sparkles,
On grass−cloth edged with brocade.
If it is worn, all demons are extinguished;
When donned it sends all monsters down to hell.
It was made by the hands of heavenly Immortals,
And none but a true monk should dare put it on.
When the aged monk saw how rare a treasure it was, his heart was indeed disturbed. He went up to Sanzang
and knelt before him. "My fate is indeed a wretched one," he lamented, tears pouring down his cheeks.
Sanzang helped him to his feet again and asked, "Why do you say that, venerable patriarch?"
"You have unfolded this treasure of yours, sir," the aged monk replied, "when it is already evening, so that my
eyes are too dim to see it clearly. That is why I say my fate is wretched."
"Send for a candle and take another look," Sanzang suggested.
"My lord, your precious cassock is already shining brightly, so I don't think I would see more distinctly even
if a candle were lit," replied the aged monk.
"How would you like to look at it then?" asked Sanzang.
"If, sir, you were in your mercy to set aside your fears and let me take it to my room to examine it closely
during the night, I will return it to you in the morning to take to the West. What do you say to that?" This
request startled Sanzang, who grumbled at Brother Monkey, "It's all your fault, all your fault."
"He's nothing to be frightened of." Monkey replied with a grin. "I'll pack it up and tell him to take it away to
look at. If anything goes wrong, I'll be responsible."
As there was nothing he could do to stop him, Sanzang handed the cassock to the old monk with the words,
"I'll let you take it, but you must give it back to me tomorrow morning in the condition it's in now. I won't
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 234
have you getting it at all dirty."
The old monk gleefully told a page to take the cassock to his room, and instructed the other monks to sweep
out the front meditation hall, move two rattan beds in, spread out the bedding on them, and invite the two
gentlemen to spend the night there; he also arranged for them to be given breakfast and seen off the next
morning. Then everyone went off to bed. Sanzang and his disciple shut the doors of the meditation hall and
went to sleep.
After the old monk had tricked them into giving him the cassock, he held it under the lamp in the back room
as he wept and wailed over it. This so alarmed the monks that none of them dared go to sleep before he did.
The young page, not knowing what to do, went to tell the other monks, "Grandad's still crying although it's
getting on for eleven." Two junior monks, who were among the old man's favorites, went over to ask him why
he was crying.
"I'm crying because my accursed fate won't allow me to see the Tang Priest's treasure," he said; to which they
replied, "Grandad, in your old age you have succeeded. His cassock is laid before you, and all you have to do
is open your eyes and look. There's no need for tears."
"But I can't look at it for long," the aged monk answered. "I'm two hundred and seventy this year, and I've
collected all those hundreds of cassocks for nothing. However am I to get hold of that one of his? However
am I to become like the Tang priest?"
"Master, you've got it all wrong," the junior monks said. "The Tang Priest is a pilgrim far from home. You
should be satisfied with your great seniority and wealth; why ever would you want to be a pilgrim like him?"
"Although I live at home and enjoy my declining years, I've got no cassock like his to wear," the aged monk
replied. "If I could wear it for a day, I would close my eyes in peace. I'd be as happy as if I were a monk in my
next life."
"What nonsense," the junior monks said. "If you want to wear his cassock, there'll be no problem about that.
We'll keep him for another day tomorrow, and you can wear it for another day. Or we can keep him for ten
days and you can wear it for ten days. So why get so upset about it?"
"Even if we kept him for a year," the old monk replied, "I'd only be able to wear it for a year, which wouldn't
bring me any glory. I'll still have to give it to him when he went: I can't keep him here for ever."
As they were talking a young monk called Broad Wisdom spoke out. "Grandad," he said, "if you want it for a
long time, that's easy to arrange too."
"What brilliant idea have you got, child?" the aged monk asked, cheering up.
"That Tang Priest and his disciple were so exhausted after their journey that they are both asleep by now,"
Broad Wisdom replied. If we arm some strong monks with swords and spears to break into the meditation hall
and kill them, they can be buried in the back garden, and nobody but us will be any the wiser. This way we get
their white horse and their luggage as well as the cassock, which will become an heirloom of the monastery.
We would be doing this for posterity." The old monk was very pleased with this suggestion, and he wiped the
tears from his eyes as he said, "Very good, very good, a marvellous plan."
Another young monk called Broad Plans, a fellow−student of Broad Wisdom's, came froward and said, "This
plan's no good. If we are to kill them, we'll have to keep a sharp eye on them. That old pale−faced one looks
easy enough, but the hairy−faced one could be tricky; and if by any chance we fail to kill him, we'll be in deep
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 235
trouble. I have a way that doesn't involve using weapons, but I don't know what you'll think of it."
"What do you suggest, my child?" the aged monk asked.
"In my humble opinion," he replied, "we should assemble the head monks of all the cells, senior and junior,
and get everyone to put a bundle of firewood outside the meditation hall. When it's set alight, those two will
have no escape, and will be burnt to death together with their horse. Even if the people who live around this
mountain see the blaze, they'll think that those two burnt down the mediation hall by carelessly starting a fire.
This way they'll both be burnt to death and nobody will know how it happened. Then the cassock will become
our monastery's treasure for ever." All the monks present were pleased with this suggestion, exclaiming,
"Great, great, great; an even better plan." The head of every cell was told to bring firewood, a scheme that was
to bring death to the venerable and aged monk, and reduce the Guanyin Monastery to ashes. Now there were
seventy or eighty cells in the monastery, and over two hundred junior and senior monks. They shifted
firewood all night, piled it up all round the meditation hall so that there was no way out, and prepared to set it
alight.
Although Sanzang and he had gone to bed, the magical Monkey's spirit remained alert and his eyes half open
even when he was asleep. His suspicions were aroused by the sound of people moving around outside and the
rustling of firewood in the breeze. "Why can I hear footsteps in the still of the night?" he wondered. "Perhaps
bandits are planning to murder us." He leaped out of bed, and was on the point of opening the door to take a
look when he remembered that this might disturb his master, so instead he used his miraculous powers to turn
himself into a bee with a shake of his body.
Sweet his mouth and venomous his tail,
Slender his waist and light his body.
He flew like an arrow, threading through willows and flowers,
Seeking their nectar like a shooting star.
A tiny body that could bear great weights,
Carried on the breeze by his frail and buzzing wings.
Thus did he emerge from under the rafters,
Going out to take a look.
He saw that the monks had piled firewood and straw all around the meditation hall and were setting it alight.
Smiling to himself he thought, "So my master was right. This is their idea. They want to kill us and keep our
cassock. I wish I could lay into them with my cudgel. If only I wasn't forbidden to use it, I could kill the lot of
them; but the master would only be angry with me for murdering them. Too bad. I'll just have to take my
chances as they come, and finish them off."
The splendid Monkey leapt in through the Southern Gate of Heaven with a single somersault, startling the
heavenly warriors Pang, Liu, Gou and Bi into bowing, and Ma, Zhao, Wen and Guan into bending low as they
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 236
all said, "Oh no, oh no! The fellow who turned Heaven upside down is here again."
"There's no need to stand on courtesy or be alarmed, gentlemen," said Monkey with a wave of his hand, "I've
come to find the Broad−Visioned Heavenly King."
Before the words were out of his mouth the Heavenly King was there and greeting Monkey with, "Haven't
seen you for ages. I heard the other day that the Bodhisattva Guanyin came to see the Jade Emperor to borrow
the four Duty Gods, the Six Dings and Jias and the Revealers of the Truth to look after the Tang Priest on his
pilgrimage to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. They were also saying that you were his disciple, so
how is it that you have the spare time to come here?"
"Let's cut the cackle," said Monkey. "The Tang priest has run into some villains who have started a fire to
burn him to death. It's very urgent, which is why I've come to ask you for the loan of your Anti−fire Cover to
save him with. Fetch it at once; I'll bring it straight back."
"You've got it all wrong," the Heavenly King replied. "If villains are trying to burn him, you should rescue
him with water. What do you need my Anti−fire Cover for?"
"You don't understand," Monkey continued. "If I try to save him with water, he may still be hurt even if he
isn't burnt up. I can only keep him free from injury if you lend me that cover; and with that it doesn't matter
how much burning they do. Buck up, buck up! It may be too late already. Don't mess up what I've got to do
down there."
"You monkey," said the Heavenly King with a laugh, "You're as wicked as ever, thinking only of yourself and
never of others."
"Hurry up, hurry up," Monkey pleaded. "You'll ruin everything if you go on nattering." The Heavenly King,
no longer able to refuse, handed the cover to Monkey.
Taking the cover, Monkey pressed down on his cloud and went straight to the roof of the meditation hall,
where he spread the cover over the Tang Priest, the dragon horse, and the luggage. Then he went to sit on top
of the aged monk's room to protect the cassock. As he watched them starting the fire he kept on reciting a
spell and blew some magic breath towards the Southwest, at which a wind arose and fanned the flames up into
a wild and roaring blaze. What a fire!
Spreading black smoke,
Leaping red flames;
The spreading black smoke blotted out all the stars in the sky,
The leaping red flames made the earth glow red for hundreds of miles.
When it started
It was a gleaming golden snake;
Later on
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 237
It was a spirited horse.
The Three Spirits of the South showed their might,
The Fire God Huilu wielded his magic power,
The bone−dry kindling burned ferociously,
As when the Emperor Suiren drilled wood to start a fire.
Flames leapt up from the boiling oil before the doors,
Brighter than when Lord Lao Zi opens his furnace.
As the cruel fire spreads,
What can stop this willful murder?
Instead of dealing with the disaster
They abetted it.
As the wind fanned the fire.
The flames flew many miles high;
As the fire grew in the might of the wind,
Sparks burst through the Nine Heavens.
Cracking and banging,
Like firecrackers at the end of the year;
Popping and bursting,
Like cannon−fire in battle.
None of the Buddha statues could escape the blaze,
And the guardian gods in the Eastern court had nowhere to hide.
It was fiercer that the fire−attack at Red Cliff,
Or the burning of the Epang Palace.
A single spark can start a prairie fire. In a few moments the raging wind had blown the fire up into an inferno,
and the whole Guanyin Monastery was red. Look at the monks as they move away boxes and baskets,
grabbing tables and carrying cooking−pots on their heads. The whole monastery was full of the sound of
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 238
shouting and weeping. Brother Monkey protected the abbot's rooms at the back, and the Anti−fire Cover
covered the meditation hall in front; everywhere else the fire raged, its red flames reflected in the sky and its
dazzling brightness shining through the wall.
When the fire broke out, all the animals and devils of the mountain were disturbed. Seven miles due South of
the Guanyin Monastery was the Black Wind Mountain, on which there was a Black Wind Cave. In this cave a
monster awoke and sat up. Seeing light streaming in through his window, he thought it must be dawn, but
when he got up to take a better look he saw a fire blazing to the North.
"Blimey," the monster exclaimed with astonishment, "those careless monks must have set the Guanyin
Monastery on fire. I'd better go and help them." The good monster leapt off on a cloud and went down below
the smoke and flames that reached up to the sky. The front halls were all empty, and the fire was burning
bright in the cloisters on either side. He rushed forward with long strides and was just calling for water when
he noticed that the rooms at the back were not burning as there was someone on the roof keeping the wind
away. The moment he realized this and rushed in to look, he saw a magic glow and propitious vapours coming
from a black felt bundle on the table. On opening it he found it contained a brocade cassock that was a rare
treasure of the Buddhist religion. His mind disturbed by the sight of this valuable object, he forgot about
putting out the fire or calling for water and grabbed the cassock, which he made off with in the general
confusion. Then he went straight back to his cave by cloud.
The fire blazed on till dawn before burning itself out. The undraped monks howled and wailed as they
searched through the ashes for bronze and iron, and picked over the cinders to find gold and silver. Some of
them fixed up thatched shelters in what remained of the frames of the buildings, and others were rigging up
pots to cook food at the bases of the exposed walls. We will not describe the weeping, the shouting and the
confused hubbub.
Brother Monkey grabbed the Anti−fire Cover, took it back to the Southern Gate of Heaven with a single
somersault, and returned it to the Broad−visioned Heavenly King with thanks. "Great Sage," said the
Heavenly King as he accepted it. "You are as good as your word. I was so worried that if you didn't give me
back my treasure, I'd never be able to find you and get it off you. Thank goodness you've returned it."
"Am I the sort of bloke who'd cheat someone to his face?" asked Monkey. "After all, 'If you return a thing
properly when you borrow it, it'll be easier to borrow it next time.'"
"As we haven't met for so long, why don't you come into the palace for a while?" said the Heavenly King.
"I'm no longer the man to 'sit on the bench till it rots, talking about the universe,'" Monkey replied. "I'm too
busy now that I have to look after the Tang Monk. Please excuse me." Leaving with all speed, he went down
on his cloud, and saw that the sun was rising as he went straight to the meditation hall, where he shook
himself, turned into a bee, and flew in. On reverting to his true form he saw that his master was still sound
asleep.
"Master, get up, it's dawn," he called.
Sanzang woke up, rolled over, and said, "Yes, so it is." When he had dressed he opened the doors, went
outside, and saw the walls reddened and in ruins, and the halls and towers gone. "Goodness," he exclaimed in
great astonishment, "why have the buildings all disappeared? Why is there nothing but reddened walls?"
"You're still asleep," Monkey replied. "There was a fire last night."
"Why didn't I know about it?" Sanzang asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 239
"I was protecting the meditation hall, and as I could see you were asleep, master, I didn't disturb you,"
Monkey replied.
"If you were able to protect the meditation hall, why didn't you put out the fire in the other buildings?"
Sanzang asked. Monkey laughed.
"I'll tell you, master. What you predicted actually happened. They fancied that cassock of ours and planned to
burn us to death. If I hadn't noticed, we'd be bones and ashes by now."
"Did they start the fire?" asked Sanzang who was horrified to learn this.
"Who else?" replied Monkey.
"Are you sure that you didn't cook this up because they were rude to you?" Sanzang asked.
"I'm not such a rascal as to do a thing like that," said Monkey. "Honestly and truly, they started it. Of course,
when I saw how vicious they were I didn't help put the blaze out. I helped them with a slight breeze instead."
"Heavens! Heavens! When a fire starts you should bring water, not wind."
"You must know the old saying−−'If people didn't harm tigers, tigers wouldn't hurt people.' If they hadn't
started a fire, I wouldn't have caused a wind."
"Where's the cassock? Don't say that it's been burnt too."
"It's all right; it hasn't been burnt. The abbots' cell where it was kept didn't catch fire."
"I don't care what you say. If it's come to any harm, I'll recite that spell till it kills you."
"Don't do that," pleaded Monkey desperately, "I promise to bring that cassock back to you. Wait while I fetch
it for you, and then we'll be on our way." With Sanzang leading the horse, and Monkey carrying the luggage,
they went out of the meditation hall and straight to the abbot's lodgings at the back.
When the grief−stricken monks of the monastery suddenly saw master and disciple emerge with horse and
luggage from the meditation hall they were terrified out of their wits, and screamed, "Their avenging ghosts
have come to demand our lives."
"What do you mean, avenging ghosts coming to demand your lives?" Monkey shouted. "Give us back our
cassock at once."
The monks all fell to their knees and kowtowed, saying, "Masters, wrongs are always avenged, and debts
always have to be paid. If you want lives, it's nothing to do with us; It was the old monk and Broad Plans who
cooked up the plot to kill you. Please don't punish us."
Monkey snorted with anger and roared, "I'll get you, you damned animals. Who asked for anyone's life? Just
bring out that cassock and we'll be on our way."
Two brave men from among the monks said, "Masters, you were burnt to death in the meditation hall, and
now you come back to ask for the cassock. Are you men or ghosts?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 240
"You cattle," sneered Monkey, "there wasn't any fire. Go and look at the meditation hall and then we'll see
what you have to say." The monks rose to their feet, and when they went forward to look, they saw that there
was not even the slightest trace of scorching on the door and the window−frames. The monks, now struck
with fear, realized that Sanzang was a divine priest, and Monkey a guardian god.
They all kowtowed to the pair of them and said, "Our eyes are blind. We failed to recognize saints sent down
from Heaven. Your cassock is in the abbot's rooms at the back." Sanzang went past a number of ruined walls
and buildings, sighing endlessly, and saw that the abbot's rooms at the back had indeed not been burnt. The
monks all rushed in shouting. "Grandad, the Tang priest is a saint, and instead of being burnt to death he's
wrecked our home. Bring the cassock out at once and give it back to him."
Now the old monk had been unable to find the cassock, which coming on top of the destruction of the
monastery had him distraught with worry. When the monks asked him for it, he was unable to reply. Seeing
no way out of his quandary, he bent his head down and dashed it against the wall. He smashed his skull open
and expired as his blood poured all over the floor. There are some verses about it:
Alas that the aged monk in his folly
Lived so long a life for nothing.
He wanted the cassock as an heirloom for the monastery.
Forgetting that what is Buddha's is not as mortal things.
As he took the changeable for the eternal,
His sorry end was quite inevitable.
What use were Broad Wisdom and Broad Plans?
To harm others for gain always fails.
The other monks began to howl in desperation, "Our Patriarch has dashed his brains out, and we can't find the
cassock, so whatever shall we do?"
"I think you've hidden it somewhere," Monkey said. "Come out, all of you, and bring me all the registers. I'm
going to check that you're all here." The senior and junior abbots brought the two registers in which all the
monks, novices, pages, and servants were registered. There were a total of two hundred and thirty names in
them. Asking his master to sit in the place of honour, Monkey called out and marked off each of the names,
making the monks open up their clothes for his inspection. When he had checked each one carefully there was
no sign of the cassock. Then he searched carefully through all the boxes and baskets that had been saved from
the flames, but again he could find no trace of it. Sanzang, now absolutely furious with Brother Monkey,
started to recite the spell as he sat up high.
Monkey fell to the ground in great agony, clutching his head and pleading, "Stop, stop, I swear to return the
cassock to you." The monks, trembling at the sight, begged him to stop, and only then did he shut his mouth
and desist.
Journey to the West
Chapter 16 241
Monkey leapt to his feet, took his iron cudgel from behind his ear, and was going to hit the monks when
Sanzang shouted, "You ape, aren't you afraid of another headache? Are you going to misbehave again? Don't
move your hand or hurt anyone. I want you to question them again instead."
The monks all kowtowed to him and entreated him most pitifully to spare their lives. "We've honestly not
seen it. It's all that dead old bastard's fault. After he saw your cassock yesterday evening he cried till late into
the night, not even wanting to look at it as he worked out a plan by which it could belong to the monastery for
ever. He wanted to burn you to death, masters, but when the fire started, a gale wind blew up, and we were all
busy trying to put the blaze out and move away what stuff we could. We don't know where the cassock went."
Monkey went into the abbot's quarters at the back in a great rage and carried out the corpse of the old monk
who had killed himself. When he stripped the body he found no treasures on it, so he dug up the floor of his
room to a depth of three feet, again without finding a sign of the cassock. Monkey thought for a moment and
then asked, "Are there any monsters turned spirits around here?"
"If you hadn't asked, sir, I'd never have imagined you wanted to know," the abbot replied. "There is a
mountain due South of here called the Black Wind Mountain, and in the Black Wind Cave−on it there lives a
Great Black King. That old dead bastard of ours was always discussing the Way with him. There aren't any
other evil spirits apart from him."
"How far is the mountain from here?" Monkey asked.
"Only about seven miles," the abbot replied. "It's the mountain you can see over there."
Monkey smiled and said to Sanzang. "Don't worry, master, there's no need to ask any more questions. No
doubt about it: it must have been stolen by that black monster."
"But his place is seven miles from here, so how can you be sure it was him?" Sanzang asked.
"You didn't see the fire last night," Brother Monkey retorted. "The flames were leaping up hundreds of miles
high, and the glow penetrated the triple heavens. You could have seen it seventy miles away, let alone seven.
I'm convinced that he saw the glare and took the chance to slip over here quietly. When he saw that our
cassock was a treasure, he must have stolen it in the confusion. Just wait while I go and find him."
"If you go, who's going to protect me?" asked Sanzang.
"Don't worry, gods are watching over you in secret, and in the visible sphere I'll make these monks serve
you." With that he called the community together and said, "I want some of you to go and bury that old ghost,
and some of you to serve my master and look after our white horse." The monks all assented obediently, and
Monkey continued, "I won't have you agreeing glibly now but not waiting on them when I've gone. Those of
you who look after my master must do so with pleasant expressions on your faces, and those who feed the
horse must make sure he gets the right amount of hay and water. If there's the slightest mistake, I'll hit you
like this." He pulled out his cudgel, and smashed a fire−baked brick wall to smithereens; the shock from this
shook down seven or eight more walls. At the sight of this the monks' bones turned to jelly, and they knelt
down and kowtowed to him with tears pouring down their cheeks.
"Don't worry, master, you can go−−we'll look after him. We promise not to show any disrespect." The
splendid Monkey then went straight to the Black Wind Mountain with a leap of his somersault cloud to look
for the cassock.

And depended entirely on the mighty Great Sage Equaling Heaven.

Chapter 17
Brother Monkey Makes Trouble on the Black Wind Mountain
Guanyin Subdues the Bear Spirit
As Monkey leapt up with a somersault, the senior and junior monks, the novices, the page−boys, and the
servants of the monastery all bowed low to the sky and said, "Master, you must be a cloud−riding Immortal
come down from Heaven. No wonder that fire can't burn you. Damn that stupid old skinflint of ours: he
destroyed himself with his own scheming."
"Please rise, gentlemen," replied Sanzang, "there's no need to hate him. If my disciple finds the cassock our
troubles will all come to an end; but if he doesn't find it, he has rather a nasty temper and I'm afraid that none
of you will escape with your lives." When they heard this warning, the monks' hearts were in their mouths,
and they implored Heaven to let him find the cassock and spare their lives.
Once in mid−air, the Great Sage Sun Wukong reached at the Black Wind Mountain with one twist of his
waist. Stopping his cloud while he took a careful look around, he saw that it was indeed a fine mountain. It
was a spring day:
The myriad valleys' streams compete,
A thousand precipices vie in beauty.
Where the birds call, no man is;
When the blossoms fall, the trees are still fragrant.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 243
After the rain, the sky and the lowering cliff are moist;
As the pines bend in the wind, they spread an emerald screen.
The mountain herbs grow,
The wild flowers blossom,
Hanging over beetling crags;
The wild fig thrives
And fine trees flourish
On craggy range and flat−topped hill.
You meet no hermits,
And can find no wood−cutters.
Beside the stream a pair of cranes drink,
And wild apes gambol on the rocks.
Peaks like mussel−shells, gleaming black,
Lofty and green as they shine through the mist.
As Monkey was looking at the mountain scenery he heard voices from in front of the grassy slope. He slipped
off to conceal himself under the rock−face and take a discreet look. He saw three fiends sitting on the ground.
At the head was a dark fellow, to his left was a Taoist, and to his right a white−robed scholar, and they were
all talking about lofty and broad matters: about refining cinnabar and mercury with tripods and cauldrons; and
about the white snow, mercury, the yellow sprout, lead, and other esoteric teachings.
In the middle of this the dark fellow said, "As it's my birthday tomorrow, I hope you two gentlemen will do
me the honour of coming along."
"We celebrate your birthday every year, Your Majesty," the white−robed scholar replied, "so of course we
shall come this year."
"I came by a treasure last night," the dark fellow went on, "a brocade cassock for a Buddha, and it's a
wonderful thing. I'm going to give a big banquet for it the day after tomorrow and I'm inviting all you
mountain officials to come and congratulate me, which is why I'm calling it a 'Buddha's Robe Banquet.'"
"Wonderful, wonderful," the Taoist exclaimed with a smile. "Tomorrow I'll come to congratulate you on your
birthday, and the day after I'll come again for the banquet."
As soon as Monkey heard him mention the Buddha's robe he was sure it was their treasure, and unable to hold
back his anger he leapt out from the cliff brandishing his gold−banded cudgel with both hands and shouting,
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 244
"I'll get you, you gang of devils. You stole our cassock, and now you think you're going to have a 'Buddha's
Robe Banquet'. Give it back to me at once."
"Don't move," he barked, swinging the cudgel and bringing it down towards the monster's head. The dark
fellow turned into a wind to flee in terror, and the Taoist rode off on a cloud; so Monkey was only able to slay
the white−robed scholar with a blow from the club. When he dragged the body over to look at it, he saw that it
was a white−patterned snake spirit. In his anger he picked the corpse up and tore it to pieces, then went into
the recesses of the mountain in search of the dark fellow. Rounding a sharp pinnacle and traversing a dizzy
precipice, he saw a cave palace in the cliff:
Thick, misty clouds,
Dense with cypress and pine.
The thick and misty clouds fill the gates with color;
The dense stands of cypress and pine surround the door with green.
For a bridge there is a dried−out log,
And wild fig coils around the mountain peaks.
Birds carry red petals to the cloud−filled valley;
Deer tread on scented bushes as they climb the stone tower.
Before the gates the season brings out flowers,
As the wind wafts their fragrance.
Around the willows on the dike the golden orioles wheel;
Butterflies flit among the peach−trees on the bank.
This ordinary scene can yet compete
With lesser views in Fairyland.
When he reached the gates Monkey saw that they were very strongly fastened, and above them was a stone
tablet inscribed with the words Black Wind Cave of the Black Wind Mountain in large letters. He brandished
his cudgel and shouted, "Open up!" at which the junior devil who was on the gates opened them and asked,
"Who are you, and how dare you come and attack our Immortals' cave?"
"You damned cur," Monkey railed at him. "How dare you call a place like this an 'Immortals' cave'? What
right have you to use the word 'Immortal'? Go in and tell that dark fellow of yours that if he gives back my
cassock at once, I'll spare your lives."
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 245
The junior devil rushed in and reported, "The 'Buddha's Robe Banquet' is off, Your Majesty. There's
hairy−faced thunder god outside the gates who's demanding the cassock."
The dark fellow, who had barely had time to shut the gates and had not even sat down properly since Brother
Monkey chased him, away from the grassy slope, thought on hearing this news, "This wretch has come from I
don't know where, and now he has the effrontery to come yelling at my gates." He called for his armour,
tightened his belt, and strode out of the gates with a black−tasseled spear in his hands. Monkey appeared
outside the gates holding his iron cudgel and glaring wide−eyed at that ferocious−looking monster.
His bowl−shaped iron helmet shone like fire;
His black bronze armour gleamed.
A black silk gown with billowing sleeves,
A dark green silken sash with fringes.
In his hands a spear with black tassels,
On his feet a pair of dark leather boots.
Lightning flashed from his golden pupils;
He was indeed the Black Wind King of the mountains.
"This wretch looks as though he's been a brick−burner or a coal−digger," Monkey thought as he smiled to
himself. "He's so black he must be the local soot−painter."
"What gives you the nerve to act so big round here, monk, and what the hell are you?" shouted the monster at
the top of his voice.
Monkey rushed him with his cudgel and roared, "Cut the cackle, and give me back the cassock at once, kid."
"What monastery d'you come from? Where did you lose the cassock? Why come and ask for it here?"
"My cassock was in the rear abbot's lodgings at the Guanyin Monastery due North of here. When the
monastery caught fire you made the most of the confusion to do a bit of looting and brought it back here, you
wretch, and now you're planning to hold a 'Buddha's Robe Banquet'. Don't try to brazen it out. Give it back at
once, and I'll spare your life, but if even a hint of a 'no' gets past your teeth I'll push the Black Wind Mountain
over, trample your cave flat, and flatten every one of you fiends into noodles."
The monster laughed evilly and replied, "You've got a nerve. You were the one who started the fire last night.
You were sitting on the roof of the abbot's lodgings and calling up a wind to make it worse. What's it to you if
I did take a cassock? Where are you from? Who are you? You must have a lot of tricks up your sleeve if you
have the nerve to talk so big."

"You can't recognize your own grandfather." Brother Monkey replied. "I, your grandfather, am the disciple of
His Highness the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of the Emperor of the Great Tang. My name is
Brother Sun Wukong. If you want to know about my tricks, just give me the word. I'll slaughter you here and
now, and send your souls flying."
"I've never heard of these tricks of yours, so you'd better tell me about them."
"Stand still and listen to me, my child," Monkey replied, and went on to say:
"Great have been my magic powers since childhood;
Changing with the wind, I show my might.
Nourishing my nature and cultivating the truth,
I have lived out the days and months,
Saving my life by jumping beyond the cycle of rebirth.
Once I searched sincerely for the Way
Climbing the Spirit Terrace Mountain to pick medicinal herbs.
On that mountain lives an ancient Immortal
One hundred and eight thousand years old.
I took him as my master,
Hoping that he would show me a road to immortality.
He said that the elixir is in one's own body−−
It is a waste of effort to seek it outside.
I learned a great spell of immortality.
I could scarcely have survived without it.
Turning my gaze inwards, I sat and calmed my mind,
While the sun and moon in my body intermingled.
Ignoring the affairs of the world, I made my desires few,
When senses, body, and mind were purified, my body was firm.
Reversing the years and returning to youth is then easily done;
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 247
The road to immortality and sagehood was not long.
In three years I acquired a magic body,
That did not suffer like a common one.
I wandered around the Ten Continents and Three Islands,
The corners of the sea and the edge of the sky.
I was due to live over three hundred years
But could not yet fly up to the Nine Heavens.
I got a real treasure for subduing sea dragons:
An iron cudgel banded with gold.
On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit
I was supreme commander;
In the Water Curtain Cave
I assembled the fiendish hosts.
The Great Jade Emperor sent me a decree
Conferring high rank and the title 'Equaling Heaven'.
More than once I wrecked the Hall of Miraculous Mist,
And stole the Queen Mother's peaches several times.
A hundred thousand heavenly soldiers in serried ranks
Came with spears and swords to put me down.
I sent the heavenly kings back up there in defeat,
Made Nazha flee in pain at the head of his men.
The True Lord Erlang, skilled at transformations,
Lao Zi, Guanyin and the Jade Emperor
Watched me being subdued from the Southern Gate of Heaven.
As he was given some help by Lord Lao Zi,
Erlang captured me and took to Heaven.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 248
I was tied to the Demon−subduing Pillar,
And divine soldiers were ordered to cut off my head.
Though hacked with swords and pounded with hammers
I remained unharmed.
So then I was struck with thunder and burned with fire.
As I really do have magic powers,
I was not in the slightest bit afraid.
They took me to Lao Zi's furnace to be refined.
The Six Dings roasted me slowly with divine fire.
When the time was up and the furnace opened, out I jumped,
And rushed round Heaven, my cudgel in my hand.
No one could stop me making trouble everywhere,
And I caused chaos in the thirty−three Heavens.
Then our Tathagata Buddha used his Dharma power
And dropped the Five Elements Mountain on my back.
There I was crushed for full five hundred years,
Until Sanzang came from the land of Tang.
Now I have reformed and am going to the West
To climb the Thunder Peak and see the Buddha.
Enquire throughout the Four Seas, Heaven and Earth:
You'll find that I'm the greatest monster ever.
On hearing this the fiend laughed and said, "So you're the Protector of the Horses who wrecked Heaven, are
you?"
Monkey, who got angrier at being addressed by this title than at anything else, was furious. "You vicious
monster. You steal the cassock and refuse to give it back, and on top of that you insult your lord and master.
Just hold it, and see how you like my club." The dark fellow dodged the blow and then riposted with his spear.
The pair of them fought a fine battle.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 249
An As−You−Will cudgel,
A black−tasseled spear,
And two men showing their toughness at the mouth of a cave.
One stabs at heart and face,
The other tries for arm and head.
This one strikes cunning sideswipes with a club,
That one brandishes his spear in three swift movements.
The white tiger climbs the mountain to sink in his claws;
The yellow dragon lying on the road turns round fast.
Snorting out coloured mists,
Disgorging rays of light,
The two immortal fiends are hard to choose between:
One is the Sage Equaling Heaven who has cultivated the truth;
The other is the Great Black King become a spirit.
On this battlefield in the mountains
The pair of them fight for the cassock.
The fiend fought some ten inconclusive rounds with Monkey, and as the sun was now rising steadily towards
the zenith, the dark fellow raised his halberd to block the iron cudgel and said, "Brother Monkey, let's lay
down our arms. I'll come back and fight you again after I've eaten."
"You accursed beast," Monkey replied, "how can you call yourself a real man? If you were, you wouldn't be
needing to eat after only half a day. I never even tasted water once in those five hundred years I spent under
the mountain, but I wasn't hungry. Stop making excuses, and don't go. I'll let you have your meal if you give
me back my cassock." The fiend waved his halberd in a feint, withdrew into the cave, and shut the doors fast
behind him. Summoning his junior goblins, he ordered that a banquet be spread and wrote invitations asking
all the devil kings of the mountain to come to the celebratory feast.
Monkey charged the gates but was unable to force them open, so he had to go back to the Guanyin Monastery,
where the monks had buried the old patriarch and were now all in attendance on the Tang Priest in the abbot's
quarters. Breakfast was over, and lunch was being brought in. Just as they were bringing soup and more hot
water, Monkey descended from the sky. The monks all bowed low and took him into the abbot's room to see
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 250
Sanzang.
"Ah, you're back, Wukong," he said. "What about the cassock?"
"I've found the answer. We misjudged these monks. It was in fact stolen by a fiend from the Black Wind
Mountain. I went to have a quiet look for him and found him sitting in front of grassy slope talking to a
white−gowned scholar and an old Taoist. He's a self−confessed monster, and he said with his own mouth that
he was inviting all the evil spirits to come and celebrate his birthday tomorrow, and that as he had come by a
brocade Buddha's robe last night he wanted to celebrate that too, so he was going to give a great feast that he
called an 'Assembly for the Celebration and Admiration of the Buddha's Robe'. I rushed him and took a swipe
at him with my club, but the dark fellow turned into a puff of wind and fled. The Taoist disappeared too, and I
was only able to kill the white−clad scholar, who was a white snake turned spirit. I went to the mouth of his
cave as fast as I could and told him to come out and fight me. He admitted that he had carried it off. We
fought for half a day without either of us winning, and then the monster went back to his cave for lunch and
shut the stone gates behind him. He was too scared to come out again, so I came back to give you this news,
master. Now we know where the cassock is, there's no need to worry that he won't give it back."
On hearing this, the monks put their hands together or kowtowed as they invoked Amitabha Buddha and
exclaimed, "He's found where it is−−we're saved."
"Don't be so happy about it," Monkey warned, "I haven't got it yet, and my master hasn't left your monastery
yet. You'll have to wait till I've recovered the cassock and my master has been seen off properly from here
before you can consider yourselves safe. And if there is the slightest mistake, remember that I'm a very
quick−tempered boss. Have you given my master the best food and tea? Have you given my horse the best
fodder?"
"Yes, yes, yes," the monks hastened to assure him. "We haven't been remiss in any way while looking after
his Reverence."
"While you were away all morning I've drunk tea three times and eaten twice, and they have not been at all
offhand with me," Sanzang explained. "You'd better go back and do everything possible to recover that
cassock."
"Don't be in such a hurry," Monkey replied. "I know where it is, and I guarantee that I'll capture this wretch
and return the cassock to you. There's no need to worry."
As he was talking the senior abbot came in, set out the vegetarian meal, and invited Lord Monkey to eat. After
swallowing a few mouthfuls Monkey mounted his magic cloud once more and went off on his hunt. On his
way he saw a junior goblin going along the main path with a rosewood box under his left arm. Guessing that
there must be some kind of letter in the box Monkey raised his cudgel and brought it down on his head. The
blow did not just kill the goblin: it left him looking like a hamburger. Throwing his remains aside, Brother
Monkey wrenched open the box and saw that it contained an invitation:
Your pupil Bear presents his humble greetings to Your Excellency, the Supreme and Venerable One of the
Golden Pool:
I am deeply grateful for the magnificent kindness that I have so frequently received from you. When I saw the
fire last night I failed to put it out, but I am sure that your divine intelligence will have suffered no harm from
it. As your pupil has been lucky enough to obtain a Buddha's robe, I am giving a banquet, to which I hope you
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 251
will come to appreciate the robe. I would be profoundly grateful if you would honour me with your presence
at the appointed time. Written two days beforehand.
On reading this, Monkey roared with laughter and said, "That crooked old monk. He thoroughly deserved to
be killed. He'd been ganging up with evil spirits, had he? It's odd that he should have lived to be two hundred
and seventy. I suppose that evil spirit must have taught him a few tricks about controlling his vital essence,
which was why he lived so long. I can remember what he looked like, so I think I'll make myself look like
him and go into that cave. This way I can see where he's put that cassock, and if I'm lucky I'll be able to get
back and save a lot of trouble.
The splendid Great Sage recited a spell, faced the wind, and made himself look just like the old monk. He hid
his cudgel, walked straight to the entrance of the cave, and shouted, "Open up."
The junior goblin opened up, and as soon as he saw him he rushed back to report, "Your Majesty, the Elder of
the Golden Pool is here." The monster was astounded.
"I've only just sent a youngster with an invitation for him, and the message can't have reached him yet. How
could he possibly have got here so fast? The youngster can't even have met him. Obviously Brother Monkey
has sent him here to ask for the cassock. Steward, hide that cassock somewhere where he won't see it."
As he came to the front gates Monkey saw that the courtyard was green with bamboo and cypress, while
peach and plum trees vied in beauty amid blossoming shrubs and fragrant orchids. It was a cave paradise. He
also saw a couplet inscribed on the gates that read:
In peaceful retirement deep in the hills, one is free of vulgar worries;
Dwelling quietly in a magic cave, happy in divine simplicity.
"This wretch has escaped from the dirt and dust of the world," thought Monkey, "and is a fiend who
understands life." Going through the gates he went further inside and passed through a triple gate. Here were
carved and painted beams, light windows and coloured doors. He saw that the dark fellow was wearing a dark
green silken tunic over which was slung a black patterned silk cloak; on his head was a soft black hat, and on
his feet a pair of dusky deerskin boots.
When he saw Monkey approaching he straightened his clothes and came down the steps to greet him with the
words, "I've been looking forward to seeing you for days, Golden Pool. Please take a seat." Monkey returned
his courtesies, and when they had finished greeting each other they sat down and drank tea. Then the evil
spirit bowed and said, "I sent you a note just now asking you to come over the day after tomorrow. Why is it
that you've come to see me today, old friend?"
"I was on my way here to visit you when I happened to see your message that you were giving a 'Buddha's
Robe Banquet,' so I hurried over to ask you to let me have a look."
"You've misunderstood, old friend," replied the evil monster with a smile. "It's the Tang Priest's cassock, and
as he's been staying at your place you must have seen it there. Why come here to see it?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 252
"When I borrowed it," Monkey said, "it was too late at night for me to be able to look at it. Since then, to my
great surprise, it has been taken by Your Majesty. On top of that, the monastery has been burnt down and I
have lost everything I own. That disciple of the Tang Priest's is quite a bold fellow, but he could not find it
anywhere. I have come here to look at it as Your Majesty has had the great good fortune to recover it."
As they were talking, a junior goblin came in from patrolling the mountain to announce, "Your Majesty, a
terrible thing's happened. Brother Monkey has killed the lieutenant who is taking the invitation by the main
path, and taken the chance of making himself look like the Elder of the Golden Pool to come here and trick
the Buddha's robe out of you."
"I wondered why the elder came today," the monster thought, "and why he came so soon, and now I see that
it's really him." He leapt to his feet, grabbed his halberd, and thrust at Monkey. Monkey pulled the cudgel
from his ear in a flash, reverted to his true form, parried the halberd's blade, jumped out from the main room
into the courtyard, and fought his way back out through the front gates. This terrified all the fiends in the cave,
scaring the wits out of young and old alike. The fine combat on the mountain that ensued was even better than
the previous one.
The courageous Monkey King was now a monk,
The cunning dark fellow had hidden the Buddha's robe.
At matching words they were both masters;
In making the most of chances there was nothing between them.
The cassock could not be seen, whatever one wished;
A hidden treasure is a true wonder.
When the junior demon on mountain patrol announced a disaster,
The old fiend in his fury showed his might.
Monkey transformed himself and fought his way out of the cave,
As halberd and cudgel strove to decide the issue.
The club blocked the lengthy halberd with resounding clangs;
The halberd gleamed as it parried the iron club.
Sun Wukong's transformations were rare on earth;
Few could rival the foul fiend's magic.
One wanted to take the robe to bring himself long life;
One had to have the cassock to return with honour.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 253
This bitter struggle was not to be broken up;
Even a Living Buddha could not have resolved it.
From the mouth of the cave the pair of them fought to the top of the mountain, and from the top of the
mountain they battled their way beyond the clouds. They breathed out wind and mist, set sand and stones
flying, and struggled till the red sun set in the West, but the contest was still undecided. Then the monster
said, "Stop for the moment, Monkey. It's too late to go on fighting tonight. Go away, go away. Come back
tomorrow, and we'll see which of us is to live and which to die."
"Don't go, my child," Monkey shouted back. "If you want to fight, fight properly. Don't use the time of day as
an excuse to get out of it." With that he struck wildly at the dark fellow, who changed himself into a puff of
wind, went back to his cave, and fastened the stone gates tightly shut.
Monkey could think of no alternative to going back to the Guanyin Monastery. Bringing his cloud down, he
called to his master, who had been waiting for him anxiously until he appeared suddenly before his eyes.
Sanzang was very glad, until seeing that there was no cassock in Monkey's hands his happiness turned to fear.
"Why haven't you got the cassock this time either?" he asked.
Brother Monkey produced the invitation from his sleeve, and as he handed it to Sanzang he said, "Master, that
fiend was friends with that dead crook. He sent a junior goblin with this invitation asking him to go to a
'Buddha's Robe Banquet'. I killed the goblin, made myself look like the old monk, went into the cave, and
tricked a cup of tea out of them. I asked him to let me see the cassock, but he wouldn't bring it out. Then as we
were sitting there a mountain patrolman of some sort gave the game away, so he started to fight me. We
fought till just now, and neither of us was on top, when he saw that it was late, shot back to his cave and shut
the stone doors behind him. This meant that I had to come back for the moment."
"How do your tricks compare with his?" Sanzang asked.
"I'm not much better than him," Monkey replied, "and I can only keep my end up." Sanzang read the
invitation and handed it to the prelate.
"Can it be that your Patriarch was an evil spirit?" he said.
The prelate fell to knees as fast as he could and said, "My lord, he was human. But because that Great Black
King was cultivating the ways of humanity he often came to our temple to discuss the scriptures with our
Patriarch, and taught him some of the arts of nourishing the divine and controlling the vital essence. That was
why they were on friendly terms."
"None of these monks have anything satanic about them," Monkey said. "They all have their heads in the air
and their feet on the ground, and are taller and fatter than I am. They're not evil spirits. Do you see where it
says 'Your pupil Bear' on the invitation? He must be a black bear who has become a spirit."
To this Sanzang said, "There's an old saying that 'Bears and baboons are alike'. If they are all animals, how
can they become spirits?" Monkey laughed and replied, "I'm an animal too, but I became the Great Sage
Equaling Heaven. I'm just the same as him. All the creatures on heaven and earth that have nine openings to
their bodies can cultivate their conduct and become Immortals."
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 254
"Just now you said his abilities were the same as yours, so how are you going to beat him and get the cassock
back?" Sanzang went on to ask. "Don't worry, don't worry," Monkey replied, "I can manage." As they were
talking, the monks brought their evening meal and invited them to eat. The Sanzang asked for a lamp and
went to bed in the front meditation hall as before. The monks all slept under thatched shelters rigged up
against the walls, leaving the abbot's quarters at the back for the senior and junior prelate. It was a peaceful
night.
The Milky Way was clear,
The jade firmament free of dust.
The sky was full of coruscating stars,
A single wave wiped out the traces.
Stilled were all sounds,
And the birds were silent on a thousand hills.
The fisherman's light beside the bank was out,
The Buddha−lamp in the pagoda dimmed.
Last night the abbot's bell and drum had sounded;
This evening the air was filled with weeping.
This night he spent asleep in the monastery. Sanzang, however, could not sleep for thinking about the cassock.
He turned over, and seeing that the sky was growing light outside the window, got straight out of bed and
said, "Monkey, it's light, go and get the cassock." Brother Monkey bounded out of bed, and in an instant a
host of monks was in attendance, offering hot water.
"Look after my master properly," he said. "I'm off."
Sanzang got out of bed and seized hold of him. "Where are you going?" he asked.
"I've been thinking," said Monkey, "that this whole business is the Bodhisattva Guanyin's fault. Although this
is her monastery and she receives the worship of all these monks, she allows that evil spirit to live in the
neighbourhood. I'm going to the Southern Sea to find her and ask her to come here herself to make that evil
spirit give us back the cassock."
"When will you come back?" Sanzang asked.
"After you've finished breakfast at the earliest, and by midday at latest, I'll have done the job. Those monks
had better look after you well. I'm off now."
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 255
No sooner were the words out of his mouth than he had disappeared without a trace and reached the Southern
Sea. Stopping his cloud to take a look, he saw:
A vast expanse of ocean,
Waters stretching till they joined the sky.
Propitious light filled the firmament,
Auspicious vapours shone over mountains and rivers.
A thousand snow−capped breakers roared at the azure vault,
A myriad misty waves reared at the sky.
Water flew in all directions,
Torrents poured everywhere.
As the water flew in all directions it echoed like thunder;
As the torrents poured everywhere they crashed and roared.
Let us leave the sea,
And consider what lay in it:
A precious mountain in many a misty color−−
Red, yellow, purple, black, green, and blue.
Then did he see the beautiful land of Guanyin,
Potaraka Island in the Southern Sea.
What a wonderful place to go−−
Towering peaks
Cutting through the sky,
With a thousand kinds of exotic flowers below them,
And every type of magical herb.
The wind shook priceless trees,
The sun shone on golden lotus.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 256
Guanyin's palace was roofed with glazed tiles,
The gates of the Tide Cave were set with tortoise shell.
In the shade of green willows parrots talked,
While peacocks called amid purple bamboo.
On the marbled stone
The protecting gods are majestically severe; .
Before the agate strand
Stands the mighty Moksa.
Not pausing to take in the whole of this exotic scene, Monkey brought his cloud straight down to land under
the bamboo grove. A number of devas were already there to meet him, and they said, "The Bodhisattva told us
some time ago that you had been converted, Great Sage, and praised you very warmly. But if you are now
protecting the Tang Priest, how have you found the time to come here?"
"Because something has happened while I've been escorting him on his journey. Please go and tell the
Bodhisattva that I'd like an audience with her." When the devas went into the cave to report this, Guanyin
summoned him inside. Monkey did as he was told and bowed to her beneath the lotus throne.
"What have you come for?" the Bodhisattva asked.
"My master's journey has brought him to a monastery of yours," Monkey replied, "and I find that although
you accept incense from its monks, you allow a black bear spirit to live in the neighbourhood, and have let
him steal my master's cassock. I've tried to take it off him a number of times but got nowhere, so now I've
come to ask you to demand it from him."
"What nonsense, you ape," the Bodhisattva retorted. "Even if a bear spirit has stolen your cassock, what
business have you to ask me to go and demand it for you? It all happened because you wanted to show it off,
you big−headed and evil baboon, in front of petty−minded people. On top of that, in your wickedness you
called up the wind to spread the fire that burnt down my monastery. And now you have the nerve to try your
tricks here."
These words from the Bodhisattva made Monkey realize that she knew all about the past and the future, so he
hastily bowed down in reverence and pleaded, "Bodhisattva, forgive your disciple his sins, everything you say
is true. All the same, my master will recite that spell again because that monster won't give back the cassock,
and I couldn't bear the agonizing headache. That's why I came to bother you, Bodhisattva. I beg you in your
mercy to help me catch that evil spirit, get the cassock back, and carry on towards the West."
"That monster's magical powers are certainly no weaker than yours," the Bodhisattva said. "Very well then,
out of consideration for the Tang Priest I'll go there with you." Monkey thanked her and bowed again, asked
her to come out, and rode on the same magic cloud as her. In next to no time they reached the Black Wind
Mountain, where they landed the cloud and headed for the cave on foot.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 257
As they were on their way, a Taoist priest appeared on the mountain slope. He was carrying a glass salver on
which were two pills of the elixir of immortality. Monkey was immediately suspicious of him, so he struck
straight at his head with the iron cudgel, sending blood splattering out from brain and chest.
"Are you still as wild as this, you ape?" the shocked Bodhisattva asked. "He didn't steal your cassock, you
didn't even know him, and he was no enemy of yours. Why kill him?"
"You may not know him, Bodhisattva," Monkey replied, "but he was a friend of the Black Bear Spirit.
Yesterday they and a white−clad scholar were sitting talking in front of the grassy mountainside. Today is the
Black Spirit's birthday, and tomorrow he was coming to the 'Buddha's Robe Banquet'. That's why I recognized
him. I'm sure that he was coming to greet that monster on his birthday."
"If that's the way it is, very well then," said the Bodhisattva. Monkey then went to lift up the Taoist to take a
look at him, and he saw that he had been a grey wolf. There was an inscription under the glass salver that lay
beside him. It read, "Made by Master Emptiness−reached" .
Brother Monkey laughed and sand, "What luck, what luck. This helps me and will save you trouble too,
Bodhisattva. This monster has confessed of his own free will, and the other monster there can be finished off
today."
"What do you mean?" the Bodhisattva asked.
"I have a saying," he replied, "that goes 'beat him at his own game'. Are you willing to let me do things my
way?"
"Tell me about it," the Bodhisattva said.
"The two pills of immortality you see on that salver will be the present we take to visit him with," said
Monkey, "and the words inscribed underneath−−'Made by Master Emptiness−reached'−−are the bait we'll set
for him. If you do as I say, I have a plan for you that does not call for force or fighting. The fiend will collapse
before our eyes, and the cassock will appear. If you won't let me have my way, then you go West, I'll go East,
we can say good−bye to the Buddha's robe, and Sanzang will be up the creek."
"You've got a cheek, you ape," replied the Bodhisattva with a smile.
"No, no, I really have got a plan," Monkey protested.
"Tell me about it then," said Guanyin.
"You know it says on the salver, 'Made by Master Emptiness−reached,' Well, Master Emptiness−reached must
be his name. Bodhisattva, if you're prepared to let me have my way, then change yourself into that Taoist. I
shall eat one of those pills and then change myself into a pill, though I'll be a bit on the big side. You are to
take the tray with the two pills on it and go to wish the fiend many happy returns. Give him the bigger of the
pills, and when he's swallowed me, I'll take over inside him. If he doesn't hand the cassock over then, I'll
weave a substitute out of his guts."
The Bodhisattva could only nod her agreement.
"What about it then?" said the laughing Monkey, and at this the Bodhisattva in her great mercy used her
unbounded divine power and her infinite capacity for transformation to control her will with her heart and her
body with her will−−in an instant she turned into Master Emptiness−reached.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 258
The wind of immortality blew around his gown,
As he hovered, about to rise to emptiness.
His dark features were as ancient as a cypress,
His elegant expression unmatched in time.
Going and yet staying nowhere,
Similar but unique.
In the last resort all comes down to a single law,
From which he is only separated by an evil body.
"Great, great," exclaimed Brother Monkey at the sight. "Are you a Bodhisattva disguised as an evil spirit, or a
Bodhisattva who really is an evil spirit?"
"Monkey," she replied with a laugh, "evil spirit and Bodhisattva are all the same in the last analysis−−they
both belong to non−being." Suddenly enlightened by this, Monkey curled up and turned himself into a pill of
immortality:
Rolling across the plate but not unstable,
Round and bright without any corners.
The double three was compounded by Ge Hong,
The double six was worked out by Shao Weng.
Pebbles of golden flame,
Pearls that shone in the daylight.
On the outside were lead and mercury,
But I cannot reveal the formula.
The pill he changed himself into was indeed a little larger than the other one. The Bodhisattva noted this and
went with the glass salver to the entrance of the fiend's cave. Here she saw
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 259
Towering crags and lofty precipices,
Where clouds grow on the peaks;
Blue cypresses and green pines
Where the wind soughs in the forest.
On towering crags and lofty precipices
The devils come and go, and few men live.
The blue cypresses and green pines
Inspire Immortals to cultivate the hidden Way.
The mountains have gullies,
The gullies have springs,
Whose gurgling waters sing like a guitar,
Refreshing the ear.
Deer on its banks,
Cranes in the woods,
Where the reticent Immortal's pipe is casually played
To delight the heart.
Here an evil spirit can attain enlightenment,
And the boundless vow of the Buddha extends its mercy.
When the Bodhisattva saw this she thought, "If the beast has chosen this cave, there must be some hope for
him." And from then on she felt compassion for him.
When she reached the entrance of the cave, the junior goblins at the gates greeted her with the words,
"Welcome, Immortal Elder Emptiness−reached." As some of them ran in to announce her, the monster came
out of the gates to meet her and say, "Master Emptiness−reached, how good of you to put yourself to this
trouble. This is an honour for me."
"Allow me to present you with this magic pill that, I venture to say, will confer immortality on you," the
Bodhisattva replied. When the two of them had finished exchanging greetings they sat down, and the monster
started to talk about the events of the previous day. The Bodhisattva quickly changed the subject by passing
the salver to him and saying, "Please accept this token of my regard for you." She observed which was the
bigger one and handed it to him with the words, "I wish Your Majesty eternal life."
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 260
The monster handed the other pill to her and said, "I hope, Master Emptiness−reached, that you will share it
with me." When they had finished declining politely, the fiend picked up the pill and was on the point of
swallowing it when it went rolling into his mouth. Then Monkey resumed his true form and struck up some
acrobatic postures, at which the fiend fell to the ground. The Bodhisattva too resumed her true form and asked
the monster for the Buddha's cassock. As Monkey had now emerged through the monster's nostrils, she was
worried that the evil spirit might misbehave again, so she threw a band over his head. He rose to his feet,
ready to run them through with his spear, but Monkey and the Bodhisattva were already up in mid−air, where
she began to recite the spell. As the monster's head began to ache, he dropped the spear and writhed in agony
on the ground. The Handsome Monkey King collapsed with laughter in the sky, while the Black Bear Spirit
rolled in torment on the earth.
"Beast, will you return to the truth now?" asked the Bodhisattva.
"I swear to, I swear to, if only you spare my life," the monster repeated over and over again.
Monkey wanted to finish him off with no more ado, but the Bodhisattva stopped him at once: "Don't kill
him−−I've got a use for him."
"What's the point in keeping that beast alive instead of killing him?" Monkey asked.
"I've got nobody to look after the back of my Potaraka Island," she replied, "so I shall take him back with me
to be an island−guarding deity."
"You certainly are the all−merciful deliverer who doesn't allow a single soul to perish," said Monkey with a
laugh. "If I knew a spell like that one of yours, I'd say it a thousand times over and finish off all the black
bears I could find."
Although the bear spirit had come round and the spell had stopped, he was still in great pain as he knelt on the
ground and begged pitifully, "Spare my life and I promise I'll return to the truth." The Bodhisattva descended
in a ray of light, placed her hands on his head, and administered the monastic discipline to him; then she told
him to take up his spear and accompany her. The black bear's evil intentions ceased from that day on, and his
unbounded perversity came to an end.
"Sun Wukong," ordered the Bodhisattva, "go back now. Serve the Tang Priest well, don't be lazy, and don't
start trouble."
"I'm very grateful to you for coming so far, Bodhisattva, and I must see you home," Monkey said. "That will
not be necessary," she replied. Monkey took the cassock kowtowed to her, and departed. The Bodhisattva
took Bear back to the sea, and there is a poem to prove it:
A magic glow shines round the golden image,
The thousand rays of glorious light.
She saves all men, giving of her pity,
Surveying the whole universe and revealing the golden lotus.
Journey to the West
Chapter 17 261
Many shall now preach the scriptures' meaning,
Nor shall there be any flaw therein.
Subduing a demon and bringing him to truth, she returns to the sea;
The religion of Emptiness has recovered the brocade cassock.
If you don't know how things developed, listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
Chapter 18
The Tang Priest Is Rescued in the Guanyin Temple
The Great Sage Removes a Monster from Gao Village
Taking his leave of the Bodhisattva, Monkey brought his cloud in to land, hung the cassock on a nanmu tree,
pulled out his cudgel, charged into the Black Wind Cave, and found not a single goblin inside. This was
because the appearance of the Bodhisattva in her true form had so terrified them that they had fled in all
directions. Evil thoughts welled up in Brother Monkey, and after piling dry firewood all around the
multi−storied gate he set it alight, turning the Black Wind Cave into a Red Wind Cave. Then he went back to
the North on a beam of magic light.
Sanzang, who had been anxiously waiting for him, was beginning to wonder why he had not come back. Had
the Bodhisattva not come when asked to, or had Monkey just made up a story to escape? As he was being
racked by these desperate thoughts, a shimmering cloud appeared in mid−air and Monkey came down and
knelt before him.
"Master, here's the cassock," he announced, to Sanzang's great joy.
All the monks of the temple were delighted too, and they exclaimed, "Wonderful, wonderful, our lives are
safe at last."
"Monkey," said Sanzang as he took the cassock from him, "when you set out this morning you reckoned that
it would only take the length of a meal, or until midday at longest. Why have you only come back now, at
sunset?" When Monkey gave him a full account of how he had asked the Bodhisattva to transform herself to
subdue the monster, Sanzang set up an incense table and bowed low to the South. That done, he said,
"Disciple, now that we have the Buddha's robe, pack our luggage as quickly as you can."
"Not so fast, not so fast," Monkey replied. "It's already evening, too late to hit the road. Let's set out tomorrow
morning."
The monks all knelt and said, "Lord Monkey is right. For one thing it's too late, and for another we made a
vow. Now that all is well and the treasure has been recovered, we would like to carry out that vow and invite
Your Lordships to share in the thanksgiving meal. Tomorrow morning we'll see you off on your way West."
"Yes, yes," urged Monkey. The monks then emptied their bags and produced everything that was left of what
they had saved from the fire to make an offering of food. Then they burnt some paper to bring blessings and
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 262
recited some sutras to ward off disaster. The ceremonies were finished that evening.
The next morning the horse was curried and the luggage packed, and then they set out. The monks escorted
them a long distance before turning back, after which Monkey led the way. It was now early spring.
The grass cushions the horse's hooves,
New leaves emerge from the willow's golden threads.
Apricot vies for beauty with peach;
The wild fig round the path is full of life.
On sun−warmed sandbanks sleep mandarin ducks;
In the flower−scented gully the butterflies are quiet.
After autumn, winter, and half of spring,
Who knows when the journey will end as they find the true word?
One evening, after they had been travelling along a desolate path for six or seven days, master and disciple
saw a distant village. "Monkey," said Sanzang, "do you see the village not far over there? Let's go and ask
them to put us up for the night; we can set off again tomorrow morning."
"Wait till I've made sure it's all right before deciding." Monkey replied, gazing at the village as his master
pulled on the silken rein. He saw
Close−planted bamboo fences,
Many a thatched roof.
Outside the gates soar lofty trees;
Houses are mirrored in the waters under a bridge.
Green grow the willows beside the road,
Fragrant bloom the flowers in the gardens.
As sun sets in the West
Birds sing in the wooded hills.
The smoke of evening rises from the stoves
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 263
Along the paths roam sheep and cattle.
Well−fed chickens and pigs sleep under the eaves,
While the drunk old man sings his song next door.
When he had surveyed the scene, Brother Monkey said, "Go ahead, master. It's definitely a good village. We
can spend the night there." Sanzang urged his horse forward, and in a few moments they were at the beginning
of the main street. A young man appeared wearing a silken turban, a blue jacket, a pair of trousers tied at the
ankles, and a pair of straw sandals. He was carrying an umbrella in his hand and a pack on his back. He was a
fine sight as he walked briskly down the street. Monkey grabbed him and asked, "Where are you going? I
want to ask you something−−where is this?"
The fellow, who was trying to break loose, shouted, "Why ask me? I'm not the only person in the village."
"Don't be angry, kind sir," replied Monkey, all smiles. "To help others is to help yourself. What harm can it do
to tell me what the place is called? We might be able to bring your troubles to an end, you know." Struggle as
he might, the fellow could not break loose, which made him leap around with fury.
"Damn it, damn it," he shouted, "I get more bullying from the old man than I can stand, and now I've got to
run into you, baldy. You've got it in for me too."
"If you're good for anything, get out of my grip," Monkey said. "Do that and I'll let you go." The young man
twisted and turned, but he could not break free−−it was as if he were held in a pair of pliers. In his temper he
threw down his umbrella and his bundle, and tore at Monkey with both hands, trying to get hold of him.
Monkey was holding the luggage in one hand, and with the other he was keeping the young man under
control, and no matter how hard the fellow tried he could not get a grip on him. Monkey, however, was now
holding him more firmly than ever, and was bursting with fury.
"Monkey," Sanzang said, "here comes someone else you can ask. Why keep such a tight grip on him? Let him
go."
"You don't understand, master," replied Monkey with a smile. "It would be no fun to ask anyone else. I have
to ask him if there's to be anything to be got out of this." Seeing that Monkey would not let him go, the fellow
started to talk.
"This is Old Gao Village in the country of Stubet, and it's called that because practically everyone here has the
surname Gao. Now let me go."
"From your get−up, you're going on a long journey," Monkey went on. "Tell me where you're going and what
you're up to, then I'll let you go."
The poor fellow had no option but to tell Monkey the truth. "I'm Gao Cai from the family of Squire Gao. His
youngest daughter is twenty and not yet married, but three years ago an evil spirit came and took her. He's
been staying with us for three years, and the old man isn't at all pleased. There's no future in having a girl
marry an evil spirit, he says. It's ruining our family, and we don't get a family of in−laws to visit. He's always
wanted to get rid of the evil spirit, but he refuses to go. Now he's shut the girl up in the back building for the
best part of a year, and he won't let any of the family see her. My old man gave me two ounces of silver and
sent me to find a priest to capture the monster. I've been on the go for ages now, and asked three or four of
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 264
them, but they were all hopeless monks or pimples of Taoists−−none of them could control him. The old
man's just been swearing at me as an utter idiot, given me five more ounces of silver as travelling expenses,
and told me to find a good priest who'll deal with the monster. Then I was grabbed by you, you evil star, and
that's made me later than ever. No wonder I shouted at you: I'm pushed around at home and pushed around
when I go out. I never thought you'd be such a good wrestler that I wouldn't be able to break out of your
clinch. Let me go now−−I've told you everything."
"You're in luck−−we're in the business," Monkey replied. "This is quite convenient; you needn't go any
further or spend any of your money. We're not hopeless monks or pimples of Taoists. We've got some real
magic powers, and we know how to deal with evil spirits. This'll do both of us a bit of good. Go back and tell
the head of your household that my master is a saintly monk, and the younger brother of the Emperor of the
East, who has sent him to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and seek the scriptures. We are very good
at controlling devils and capturing monsters."
"Don't lie to me," the young man replied. "I've had enough of being pushed around. If you're tricking me, you
haven't really got any special powers, and you can't capture that fiend, you'll only be getting me into more
trouble than ever."
"I swear I'm not fooling you," answered Monkey. "Show us the way to your front door."
The young man saw that there was nothing for it but to pick up his bundle and umbrella, turn round, and take
the two of them to his gate, where he said to them, "Reverend gentlemen, would you mind sitting here on the
verandah for a moment while I go in and tell the master?" Only then did Monkey let go of him, put down the
carrying−pole, take the horse's reins, and stand beside his master, who sat down by the gate.
The young man went in through the gate and straight to the main hall, where he happened to meet Squire Gao.
"Well, you savage, who have you come back instead of going to find someone?" Squire Gao demanded.
Putting down his bundle and umbrella, the young man replied, "I must report to you, sir, that I had just got to
the end of the street when I met a couple of monks. One was on horseback, and the other had a carrying−pole
on his shoulder. He grabbed me and wouldn't let me go, and asked me where I was going. I refused to tell him
several times, but he had me locked in a grip I couldn't get out of, so I had to tell him all about the mission
you gave me, sir. He was absolutely delighted when he heard about it, and wanted to catch that monster for
us."
"Where are they from?" Squire Gao asked. "He says that his master is a saintly monk, the younger brother of
the Emperor of the East, who has sent him to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and seek the scriptures,"
the young man replied.
"But even if they're monks from far away, they may not really be capable of anything. Where are they now?"
"Waiting outside the gate."
The old man quickly put on his best clothes and went out with the youngster to greet them, addressing them as
"Venerable Elders." Sanzang turned hurriedly round when he heard this, and found them standing before him.
The older man was wearing a black silk turban, an onion−white robe of Sichuan brocade, a pair of calf−skin
boots the color of unpolished rice, and a belt of black silk.
He came forward and said with a smile, "Greetings, Venerable Elders," as he bowed, holding his hands
together. Sanzang returned his bow, but Monkey stood there immobile. At the sight of Brother Monkey's ugly
face the old man decided not to bow to him.
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 265
"Why won't you pay your respects to me?" Monkey asked, at which the old man, somewhat frightened, said to
the young man, "You'll be the death of me, you little wretch. We've already got one hideous monster at home
as a son−in−law we can't get rid of, so why ever did you have to bring this thunder god here to ruin us?"
"Gao, old chap, you've been living all these years for nothing−−you've still got no sense. It's completely
wrong to judge people by their faces. I may be no beauty, but I'm quite clever. I'll grab that evil spirit for you,
catch that demon, seize your son−in−law, and give you back your daughter. I'll be doing you a good turn, so
there's no need to fuss about my looks." The old man, now shaking with fear, pulled himself together and
asked them in. Monkey took the horse's bridle, told the young man to carry the luggage, and went in with
Sanzang. In his usual devil−may−care way he tethered the horse to one of the pillars of an open−air pavilion,
pulled up a gleaming lacquered armchair, and told his master to sit down. Then he brought over a chair for
himself and sat beside him.
"The younger venerable elder has already made himself at home," Squire Gao remarked.
"I'd feel at home here if you entertained us for six months," Brother Monkey replied.
When they were all seated the old man said, "The boy told me a moment ago that you were from the East."
"That's right," Sanzang replied. "The court has sent me to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask
for the scriptures. As we are passing this way on our journey, we would like to spend the night here before
continuing on our way tomorrow morning."
"If you two gentlemen just want to spend the night here, why all the talk about catching monsters?"
"As we'll be spending the night here," Monkey put in, "we though it would be fun to catch a few monsters
while we're about it. May I ask how many there are in your residence?"
"Good heavens," the old man exclaimed, "however many do you want? We've only got this monster of a
son−in−law, and he's ruined our lives."
"Tell me all about this monster from the beginning," Monkey said. "I must know about his magic powers if
I'm to capture him for you."
"This village has never had any trouble from ghosts, demons or evil spirits before. It was my misfortune to
have no son, and three daughters, of whom the eldest is called Fragrant Orchid, the second Jade Orchid, and
the third Blue Orchid. The other two were betrothed to men from the village when they were children and
have been married off. I wanted the third to marry a man who would live here to support−me in my old age,
look after the household, and do jobs about the place. About three years ago a good−looking young fellow
turned up who said that his name was Zhu and he came from the Mountain of Blessing. He told me that he
had no parents or brothers, and wanted to marry and live with his in−laws. As he had no family commitments
I offered him my daughter's hand, old fool that I am, and from the moment he became a member of our family
he worked very hard. He ploughed and hoed without using oxen or tools; and he didn't need a scythe or a stick
to harvest the crops. As day followed day, there was nothing wrong with him, except that he started to look
different."
"How?" Monkey asked.
"At first he was a plump, dark chap, but later on he became a long−nosed, big−eared idiot with thick black
hairs running down from the back of his head and a great, thick body. His face is just like a pig's. His appetite
is enormous, too. He needs several bushels of grain at every main meal, and over a hundred griddle−cakes for
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 266
breakfast. Luckily he is a vegetarian. If he ate meat and wine he would have ruined us in six months."
"He has to eat so much because he works so hard," Sanzang commented.
"But that's not the main thing." Squire Gao continued. "He can also summon up a wind, make clouds and mist
come and go, and send pebbles and sand flying. He's terrified our neighbors, who don't feel safe living here
any longer! He's shut my daughter away in the building at the back, and nobody's seen her for six months. We
don't even know if she's still alive. That is how we know he's an evil monster, and why we want a priest to
come and get rid of him."
"No difficulty there," Monkey replied. "Don't worry, old chap, I guarantee that I'll get him tonight, make him
write out a document divorcing your daughter, and bring her back to you. What do you say to that?"
"Because I thought there'd be no harm in offering him my daughter, I've ruined my reputation and estranged
all my relations," Squire Gao replied. "If you can catch him, why bother with a divorce document? Wipe him
out for me, if you please."
"Easy, easy," said Monkey. "I'll get him tonight."
The old man was delighted. He had a table and chairs set out and wiped clean, and a vegetarian meal brought
in. When the meal was over and he was about to go to bed, the old man asked, "What weapons and how many
men will you need? I'll get everything ready in good time."
"I have a weapon," Monkey replied.
"You two gentlemen only have your monastic staves−−how will you be able to kill the fiend with them?" the
old man asked. Monkey produced the embroidery needle from his ear, held it between his fingers, and shook
it in the wind. It turned into the gold−banded cudgel as thick as a rice−bowl. Monkey turned to Squire Gao
and asked, "How does this cudgel compare with the weapons you have in here? Will it do to kill the
monster?"
"So you have the weapon," the old man went on, "but what about the men?"
"I can do it single−handed." Monkey replied, "though I would like a few respectable old gentlemen to come in
and keep my master company while I'm away from him. When I've captured the monster they can witness his
confession before I wipe him out for you." The old man thereupon sent his servants to ask a few old friends
over, and before long they had all arrived. When the introductions were over Monkey said, "Master, you sit
here and don't worry. I'm off."
Just watch Monkey as with his cudgel in his hand he takes hold of the old man and says, "Take me to the
building at the back. I want to see where this evil spirit lives." Squire Gao led him to the door of the back
building, and Monkey told him to bring the key at once. "Look here," the old man answered, "if a key would
have done the trick, I wouldn't have had to ask for your services."
"Can't you tell at your age when someone's joking?" Monkey asked. "I was only teasing. You shouldn't have
taken me seriously." He felt the lock and found that molten copper had been poured into it, so he struck it a
vicious blow with his cudgel and shattered it. Pushing the doors open, he saw that it was pitch−black inside.
"Call your daughter's name, Old Gao, to see whether she's in here," he said.
The old man summoned up his courage and called her name, and the daughter, recognizing her father's voice,
answered feebly, "Dad, I'm in here." With a roll of his golden pupils Monkey peered into the darkness to take
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 267
a closer look at her. Do you know what she was like?
Her cloudy hair was tangled and unkempt,
Her face was filthy and unwashed.
Her orchid heart was as pure as ever,
But her beauty lay in ruins.
There was no blood or life in her cherry lips,
And her limbs were crooked and bent.
A sad frown on her forehead,
Her eyebrows pale;
Weak and frightened,
Only daring to whisper.
When she came out and saw her father, she grabbed hold of him, put her hand round his head, and wept.
"Don't cry," Monkey said, "don't cry. Where has the monster gone?"
"I don't know. These days he's been setting out at dawn and only coming back in the middle of the night.
There's always so much cloud and mist that I can't tell where he goes. He knows that my father wants to
exorcise him, so he's always on the alert. That's why he comes back late and leaves at dawn."
"Of course he would," Monkey remarked, adding, "old fellow, take the girl to the front building. You two can
have a good long talk; I'm going to wait for the monster here. Don't be surprised if he doesn't turn up; but if he
does, I'll wipe him out for you." The old man happily took his daughter to the front building.
Monkey then used some of his magic powers to turn himself into the likeness of the girl with a shake of his
body. Then he sat down in the room to wait for the evil spirit. Before long there was a marvellous wind that
sent stones and dust flying:
At first it was a gentle breeze,
That gradually became a tremendous gale.
When it was a gentle breeze, it filled Heaven and Earth;
When it grew, nothing could withstand it.
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 268
It stripped off flowers and snapped willows like stalks of hemp,
Uprooting forests as if it were picking vegetables.
It threw rivers and seas into turmoil, to the fury of gods and devils,
Splitting rocks and mountains as Heaven and Earth watched in horror.
The flower−eating deer lost their way,
The fruit−plucking monkeys did not know where they were.
Seven−storied iron pagodas fell on the Buddha's head,
The streamers in the temple fell on the jeweled canopy.
Golden beams and pillars of jade were shaken from their roots,
Tiles flew from the roof like swallows.
As the boatman raised his oar he made a vow,
Quickly sacrificing a pig and a goat as he pushed off.
The guardian god of the city ward abandoned his shrine,
The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas bowed to Heaven.
The yaksha demons' boats were wrecked on the coast,
And half the length of the Great Wall was blown down.
As this gale wind passed, an evil spirit appeared in mid−air. He was certainly ugly with his dark face, stubbly
hair, long nose, and big ears. He wore a cotton tunic that was somewhere between black and blue, and round
his waist was a patterned cotton cloth. "So that's what he's like," thought Monkey with a secret smile, and
without greeting him or asking him anything he lay down on the bed, breathing heavily and pretending to be
ill. Not knowing who this really was, the monster came straight in, put his arms around him and was going to
kiss him.
Monkey laughed to himself again as he thought, "So he really wants to screw me." Then he thrust his hand up
under the monster's long nose to throw him off balance. The monster fell off the bed.
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 269
As the monster pulled himself up he leaned on the edge of the bed and said, "Darling, why are you so angry
with me today? Is it because I'm late?"
"I'm not angry," Monkey replied, "not angry at all."
"If you're not angry with me, why did you make me fall over?"
"You should have been more thoughtful and not tried hugging me and kissing me. I'm not feeling very well
today. If I'd been my usual self I'd have been waiting for you at the door. Take your clothes off and come to
bed." Not realizing what he was up to, the monster undressed. Monkey jumped out of bed and sat on the pot
as the monster went back to bed and groped around without finding the girl.
"Where've you gone, darling?" he asked. "Take your clothes off and come to bed."
"Go to sleep," Monkey replied, "I'm taking a shit." The monster did as he was told. Monkey sighed and said,
"What terrible luck."
"What are you so fed up about?" the monster asked. "What do you mean by 'terrible luck'? I may have eaten
some food and drunk some tea since marrying you, but I haven't been idle either. I've swept for your family
and dug ditches, I've shifted bricks and tiles, I've built walls for you, I've ploughed and weeded your fields,
I've sown your wheat, and I've transplanted your rice. I've made your family's fortune. These days you dress in
brocade and have golden pins in your hair. You have fruit and flowers in all four seasons, and vegetables for
the pot throughout the year. But despite this you're still not satisfied, groaning and moaning like that and
complaining about your 'terrible luck.'"
"I didn't mean that," Monkey replied. "Today I could hear my parents through the wall. They were smashing
up bricks and tiles and pretending to curse and beat me."
"Why should they want to do that?" the monster asked.
"They said that since we married and you became their resident son−in−law, all respectability has gone by the
board. They were complaining about having such an ugly fellow as you around, and about never meeting any
brother−in−law or other relations of yours. Besides, with all that wind and cloud whenever you come in or go
out, they wonder who on earth you can be and what you are called. You're ruining their reputation, and
disgracing the family. That's why they were so angry that they went through the motions of beating and
cursing me."
"I may be a bit of an eyesore," the monster said, "but if you want me to be a good−looker I can fix that
without any difficulty. When I first came I had a word with your father, and he agreed to the marriage of his
own free will. Why is he talking like this now?" My home is the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mount of
Blessing. My surname, Zhu, is like my face−−piggy−−and my correct name is Zhu Ganglie, Iron−Haired pig.
You tell them all that if they ask you again.
"He's an honest monster," thought Monkey with delight. "If he came out with all this without being tortured.
Now I know who he is and where he's from, I'm sure I can catch him."
"He's sent for a priest to come and catch you," Monkey said aloud.
"Come to bed, come to bed, and forget about him," the monster said with a laugh. "I can do as many
transformations as the Plough, and I have my nine−pronged rake too, so what have I to fear from priests,
monks or Taoists? Even if your old man were holy enough to summon the Demon−destroying Patriarch down
Journey to the West
Chapter 18 270
from the Ninth Heaven, he's an old friend of mine and wouldn't do anything to harm me."
"My father said that he'd asked that fellow by the name of Sun, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made
such trouble up in the Heavenly Palace some five hundred years ago, to come and capture you."
The monster was somewhat taken aback on hearing this name, and said, "In that case I'm off. We're through."
"You can't just go like that," said Monkey.
"You wouldn't know," the monster replied, "but that Protector of the Horses who made such trouble in the
Heavenly Palace is quite a fighter. I might not be able to beat him, and that would spoil my good name." With
these words he pulled on his clothes, opened the door, and was just going out when Monkey grabbed him,
gave his own face a rub, and changed back into his real form.
"Where d'you think you're going, my fine monster?" he roared, adding, "take a look and see who I am." The
monster turned round and saw Monkey's protruding teeth, pinched face, fiery eyes with golden pupil, bald
head and hairy face. At the sight of this thunder god incarnate his hands were numbed and his legs paralyzed;
then with a great tearing sound he broke free, ripping his clothes, and escaped in the form of a hurricane.
Monkey rushed after him, grabbed his iron cudgel, and took a swipe at the wind. The monster then changed
into ten thousand sparks and went straight back to his mountain. Monkey mounted his cloud and went after
him shouting, "Where d'you think you're going? If you go up to Heaven, I'll chase you as far as the Dipper and
Bull Palace, and if you go into the Earth, I'll pursue you as far as the Hell of the Unjustly Slain."
Goodness! If you don't know how far he chased the monster, or who won in the end, listen to the explanation
in the next chapter.

On Pagoda Mountain Xuanzang Receives the Heart Sutra
The monster shot forward as a stream of sparks, with the Great Sage behind him on his coloured cloud. As he
was racing along, Monkey saw a tall mountain appear in front of them. Here the monster put himself together
again by reassembling the sparks, rushed into a cave, and came out with a nine−pronged rake in his hand to do
battle.
"Wretch," shouted Monkey, "where are you from? How do you know my name, you evil demon? What
powers have you got? Tell me honestly, and I'll spare your life."
"You don't know what I can do," the monster replied. "Come a little nearer and stand still while I tell you:
I was born stupid,
An idler and a slacker.
I never nourished my nature or cultivated the truth,
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 271
But spent my time in primal ignorance.
Then I happened to meet a true Immortal,
Who sat down with me and chatted about the weather,
Advised me to reform and not to sink among mortals,
For taking life was a heinous sin.
One day, when my life came to an end,
It would be too late to regret the punishments in store.
His words moved me to seek reform,
And my heart longed for miraculous spells.
I was lucky enough to have him as my teacher;
He showed me the gates of Heaven and Earth.
He taught me the Nine Changes and the Great Return of Cinnabar,
As we worked by night and day with never a break.
It reached up to the Mud Ball Palace in my head,
And down to the Bubbling Spring in my feet.
The circulating magic liquid reached the Flowery Pool under my tongue,
And the Cinnabar Field in my abdomen was given extra warmth.
The Babe, lead, and the Girl, mercury, were married,
And combining together, they divided into sun and moon.
The Dragon and the Tiger were harmonized,
The Sacred Tortoise drank the Golden Crow's blood.
The Three Flowers gathered at the top and returned to the root.
The Five Essences faced the Origin and flowed in all directions.
When their work was done, I could fly,
And the Immortals of Heaven came in pairs to greet me.
Coloured clouds grew beneath my feet,
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 272
As I faced Heavenly Palace gates with a body light and strong.
The Jade Emperor gave a banquet for all the Immortals,
And all lined up according to their grades.
I was made Field Marshal in charge of the Milky Way,
Commanding all the sailors on that river in the sky.
When the Queen Mother gave a Peach Banquet,
She invited many guests to the Jade Pool.
As drunkenness clouded my mind that day,
I lurched and staggered around.
As I charged in drunken pride into the Cool Broad Palace
I was greeted by an exquisite immortal maiden.
At the sight of her beauty my soul was captivated,
And I could not repress my mortal passions of old.
Losing all sense of rank and dignity,
I seized the beauty and asked her to sleep with me.
Three times, four times she refused,
Dodging and trying to hide in her distress.
Great was the courage of my lust, and I roared like thunder,
All but shaking down the gates of heaven.
The Miraculous Inspecting Officer reported to the Jade Emperor,
And from that day I was doomed.
The Cool Broad Palace was closely surrounded.
I could neither advance nor retreat: escape was impossible.
Then I was arrested by the gods,
But as I was still drunk I was not scared.
I was marched to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to see the Jade Emperor,
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 273
And, after questioning, sentenced to death.
Luckily the Great White Planet
Stepped forward, bowed low, and interceded.
My sentence was commuted to two thousand strokes of the heavy rod,
Which tore my flesh and all but smashed my bones.
I was released alive and expelled from Heaven,
So I tried to make a living on the Mount of Blessing.
For my sins I was reborn from the wrong womb,
And now I am known as Iron−haired Pig."
"So you are an earthly reincarnation of Marshal Tian Peng," said Brother Monkey when he heard this. "No
wonder you knew my name."
"Ha," the monster snorted angrily. "Your insane rebellion caused trouble for very many of us, Protector of the
Horses. Have you come here to throw your weight around again? I'll teach you some manners. Take this!"
Monkey was in no mood to spare him after this, and he struck at the monster's head with his cudgel. The pair
of them fought a magnificent midnight battle on that mountainside:
Monkey's golden pupils flashed with lightning;
The monster's glaring eyes sparked silver.
One disgorged coloured mist,
The other breathed out red clouds.
The red clouds lit up the night;
The coloured mists illuminated the darkness.
A gold−banded cudgel,
A nine−toothed rake,
And two splendid heroes.
One a Great Sage down among the mortals,
The other a marshal banished from Heaven.
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 274
One had been stripped of his honors and become a monster,
The other had been saved when he took service with a priest.
When the rake attacked, it was like a dragon stretching its claws;
The cudgel blocked it as nimbly as a phoenix flying through flowers.
Pig said,
"In wrecking my marriage your crime is as great as parricide."
Monkey replied,
"You deserve to be arrested for raping that young girl."
Amid these exchanges
And wild shouts,
The cudgel and the rake crossed and clashed.
They fought each other till the day began to dawn,
And the monster's arms were tired right out.
They fought from the second watch of the night until the sky began to grow light in the East. The monster, no
longer able to resist his enemy, broke away and fled, turning himself into a hurricane again. He went straight
back to his cave, shut the gates behind him, and did not come out. Monkey saw a stone tablet outside the cave
on which was inscribed CLOUD PATHWAY CAVE. The monster did not come out again and it was now
broad daylight, so Monkey thought that as his master might be waiting for him he had better go back to see
him. He could come back later to catch the monster. He gave his cloud a kick and was back in Old Gao
Village in an instant.
Sanzang, meanwhile, had been talking all night with the elders about things ancient and modern, and had not
slept a wink. Just as he was beginning to think that Brother Monkey would not come back, Monkey appeared
in the courtyard, put away his iron club, straightened his clothes, and entered the main room.
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 275
"Master, I'm here," he announced, giving the old men such a surprise that they all fell to their knees and
thanked him for his efforts.
"You've been out all night, Monkey," Sanzang said. "Where did you catch that evil spirit?"
"He's no common or garden ghost, master," Monkey replied, "and he isn't an ordinary wild animal turned
monster. He is Marshal Tian Peng, who was exiled to the mortal world. As he was placed in the wrong womb
he has a face like a wild boar, but he's still kept his original divine nature. He says that he takes his name from
his looks and is called Zhu Ganglie, Iron−haired Pig. I was going to kill him in the building at the back, but he
turned into a hurricane and fled. When I struck at this wind, he changed into sparks, went straight back to his
cave, came out with a nine−pronged rake, and fought me all night. He broke off the engagement in terror as
the dawn broke and shut himself in his cave. I was going to smash down the gates and have it out with him,
but then it occurred to me that you might be worried after waiting for me so long, so I came back to put you in
the picture first."
After Monkey had made his report, Squire Gao came up and knelt before him saying, "Venerable sir, I'm
afraid that although you've chased him away, he'll come back after you've gone; so this is no real solution.
Please, I beg of you, catch him for me and exterminate him to prevent trouble later. I promise you that I shall
not be remiss if you do this for me, and there will, of course, be rich rewards. I shall write a deed, witnessed
by my relations and friends, giving you half of my property and my land. Please, please eradicate this evil
weed and save the honour of the family."
"You've got no sense of what's proper, old man," replied Monkey with a grin. "He told me that although he
may have put away a lot of your rice and tea, he's also done you a lot of good. You've piled up a lot of wealth
in the past few years, all thanks to his efforts. He says he hasn't been eating your food in idleness, and wants
to know why you're trying to have him exorcised. He maintains that he is a heavenly Immortal come down to
earth who has been working for your family and has never harmed your daughter. I would say that he is a very
fitting son−in−law for you, who does your family's name no harm. You really ought to keep him."
"Venerable sir," the old man replied, "he may never have done anything wicked, but it does our reputation no
good to have a son−in−law like him. Whether he does anything or not, people say that the Gaos have asked a
monster to marry into the family, and I simply can't bear to hear a thing like that."
"Go and have it out with him, and then we'll see what to do," said Sanzang.
"I'll try a trick on him this time," Monkey replied. "I guarantee to bring him back this time for you to look at.
But don't be angry with him."
"Old Gao," he continued, addressing the old man, "look after my master well. I'm off."
By the time the words were out of his mouth, he had disappeared. He leapt up the mountain and smashed the
gates of the cave to splinters with a single blow of his cudgel, shouting, "Come out and fight Monkey, you
chaff−guzzling moron." The monster, who had been snoring inside, heard the gates being smashed and the
insulting "chaff−guzzling moron," and went wild with fury.
Seizing his rake and summoning up his spirit, he rushed out and shrieked, "You shameless Protector of the
Horses. What have I ever done to you to make you smash down my gates? You'd better take a look at the
statute book: there's the death penalty for breaking and entering."
"You fool," laughed Monkey, "I've got a very good justification for smashing your gates−−you abducted a girl
by force, without matchmakers or witnesses, and without giving proper presents or observing the right
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 276
ceremonies. You're a fine one to talk about who deserves to have his head cut off."
"Stop talking such nonsense and see how this rake of mine strikes you," the monster replied.
Blocking the blow with his cudgel, Monkey retorted, "Is that the rake you used when you were tilling the
fields and growing vegetables for the Gaos as their hired hand? What's so wonderful about it that I should be
afraid of you?"
"You don't realize that it's no ordinary weapon," the monster replied. "You'd better listen while I tell you
about it:
This was refined from divine ice−iron,
Polished till it gleamed dazzling white,
Hammered by Lord Lao Zi himself,
While Ying Huo fed the fire with coal−dust.
The Five Emperors of the Five Regions applied their minds to it,
The Six Dings and Six jias went to great efforts.
They made nine teeth of jade,
Cast a pair of golden rings to hang beneath them,
Decorated the body with the Six Bright Shiners and the Five planets,
Designed it in accordance with the Four Seasons and the Eight Divisions.
The length of top and bottom match Heaven and Earth.
Positive and Negative were to left and right, dividing the sun and moon.
The Six Divine Generals of the Oracular Lines are there, following the Heavenly Code;
The constellations of the Eight Trigrams are set out in order.
It was named the Supremely Precious Gold−imbued Rake,
And served to guard the gates of the Jade Emperor's palace.
As I had become a great Immortal,
I now enjoyed eternal life,
And was commissioned as Marshal Tian Peng,
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 277
With this rake to mark my imperial office.
When I raise it, fire and light stream forth;
When I lower it, a snowy blizzard blows.
It terrifies the Heavenly Generals,
And makes the King of Hell too quake with fear.
There is no other weapon matching it on Earth,
Nor iron to rival it throughout the world.
It changes into anything I like,
And leaps about whenever I say the spell.
For many a year I've carried it around,
Keeping it with me every single day.
I will not put it down even to eat,
Nor do I when I sleep at night.
I took it with me to the Peach Banquet,
And carried it into the celestial court.
When I sinned my sin in drunken pride,
I used it to force compliance with my evil will.
When Heaven sent me down to the mortal dust,
I committed all kinds of wickedness down here.
I used to devour people in this cave,
Until I fell in love and married in Gao Village.
This rake has plunged beneath the sea to stir up dragons,
And climbed high mountains to smash up tigers' dens.
No other blade is worth a mention
Besides my rake, the sharpest weapon ever.
To win a fight with it requires no effort;
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 278
Of course it always brings me glory.
Even if you have an iron brain in a brazen head and a body of steel,
This rake will scatter your souls and send your spirit flying."
Monkey put his cudgel away and replied, "Stop shooting your mouth off, you idiot. I'm now sticking my head
out for you to hit. Let's see you scatter my souls and send my spirits flying." The monster raised his rake and
brought it down with all his might, but although flames leapt forth, it did not even scratch Monkey's scalp.
The monster's arms and legs turned to jelly with fright as he exclaimed, "What a head, what a head."
"You wouldn't know," Monkey replied. "When I was captured by the Little Sage for wrecking the Heavenly
Palace, stealing the pills of immortality and the heavenly peaches, and filching the imperial wine, I was
marched to a place outside the Dipper and Bull Palace, where all the gods of Heaven hacked at me with axes,
hit me with maces, cut at me with swords, stabbed at me with daggers, tried to burn me with lightning, and
pounded me with thunder; but none of it hurt me in the slightest. Then I was taken off by the Great High Lord
Lao and put in the Eight Trigrams Furnace, where I was refined with divine fire, so that my eyes are now
fiery, my pupils golden, my head brazen, and my shoulders of iron. If you don't believe me, try a few more
blows to see whether you can hurt me or not."
"I remember you, you baboon," the monster replied. "When you made trouble in Heaven, you lived in the
Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Continent of Divine
Victory. I haven't heard of you for a very long time. What brings you here, and why are you bullying me in
front of my own gates? Surely my father−in−law didn't go all that way to ask you to come here?"
"No," said Monkey, "he didn't. I have turned away from evil and been converted to good. I have given up
Taoism and become a Buddhist. I am protecting the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of the Great Tang
Emperor, on his journey to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. We happened to
ask for a night's lodging when we came to Gao Village, and in the course of our conversation Old Gao asked
me to rescue his daughter and capture you, you chaff−guzzling moron."
The monster dropped his rake to the ground, chanted a respectful "na−a−aw," and said, "Where's this pilgrim?
Please take me to meet him."
"What do you want to see him for?" Monkey asked.
"Guanyin converted me and told me to obey the monastic rules and eat vegetarian food here till I could go
with that pilgrim, the one who's going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and ask for the
scriptures. I'll be able to make up for my sins through this good deed, and win a good reward. I've been
waiting for him for years, but there's been no news of him till now. If you're a disciple of his, why didn't you
say something about fetching the scriptures before, instead of making this vicious attack on me in my own
home?"
"This had better not be a trick to soften me up and make me let you get away," said Monkey. "If you really
want to protect the Tang Priest and you aren't trying to kid me, then you'd better make a vow to Heaven, and
I'll take you to meet my master." The monster fell to his knees with a thud, and kowtowed to the sky so often
that he looked like a rice pestle.
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 279
"Amitabha Buddha," he cried out, "if I'm not completely sincere, cut me up into ten thousand bits for breaking
the laws of Heaven."
After hearing him swear this oath, Monkey said, "Very well then, now light a brand and burn this place of
yours out. If you do that, I'll take you." The monster piled up some reeds and brambles, lit a brand, and set the
Cloud Pathway Cave on fire; it burned as well as a brick kiln that has got out of control. "I've no second
thoughts," he said, "so please take me to see him."
"Give me that rake of yours," Monkey ordered, and the monster obediently handed it over. Monkey then
plucked out a hair, blew on it with magic breath, and shouted, "Change!" It turned into three lengths of
hempen rope, with which he bound the monster's hands behind his back; the monster docilely put his hands
there and let Monkey tie him up. Then Monkey seized him by the ear and led him off with the words, "Quick
march."
"Take it easy," the monster pleaded. "You're pulling so hard you're hurting my ear."
"Can't be done," Monkey replied. "Can't show you any favours. As the old saying has it, 'even a good pig must
be handled roughly.' Wait until you've seen my master. If you really are sincere, you'll be released then." The
two of them went back through cloud and mist to Gao Village, and there is a poem to prove it:
The Golden Vajra is stronger than Wood,
The Mind Ape could bring the Wooden Dragon to submission.
When Metal obeyed and Wood was tamed they were at one;
When Wood was loving and Metal kind they worked together.
One host and one guest with nothing to keep them apart,
With the three in harmony they had a mysterious power.
Nature and feelings both rejoiced as they joined in the Supreme Principle;
They both promised without reservation to go to the West.
In a moment they were back at the village. Holding the monster's rake in one hand and twisting his ear with
the other, he said, "Do you know who that is sitting up straight in the main hall? It's my master."
When Old Gao and all his friends and relations saw Monkey coming, tugging the bound monster by his ear,
they all came into the courtyard and said happily, "Venerable sir, this is the son−in−law all right." The
monster went forward, fell to his knees, and kowtowed to Sanzang with his hands behind his back.
"Master," he shouted, "Your disciple failed to welcome you. Had I known, master, that you were staying in
my father−in−law's house, I'd have come to greet you and do homage, and I'd have been saved all this agony."
"How did you make him submit and come to pay homage?" Sanzang asked Monkey.
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 280
Monkey then let the monster go, hit him with the handle of the rake, and yelled, "Tell him, fool." The monster
then told Sanzang all about how he had been converted by the Bodhisattva.
Sanzang was so pleased that he asked Squire Gao for an incense table to be brought, which was done at once.
Sanzang then washed his hands, burnt incense, bowed low to the South, and said, "Thanks be to the
Bodhisattva for her divine grace." The elders also burnt incense and bowed low in worship. When this was
done, Sanzang took the seat of honour in the hall and told Monkey to untie the monster. Monkey shook
himself to take his hairs back, and the ropes untied themselves. The monster bowed to Sanzang once more and
vowed to go to the West with him. Then he bowed to Monkey as his elder brother because he had joined first,
addressing him as "elder brother" from then on. "If you wish to earn a good reward by going with me as my
disciple, I'll give you a Buddhist name to call you by."
"Master," he replied, "When the Bodhisattva laid her hands upon my head and told me to obey the
prohibitions, she gave me a Buddhist name−−Zhu Wuneng, Pig Awakened to Power."
"Wonderful, wonderful," said Brother Monkey with a smile, "I'm called Wukong, Awakened to Emptiness,
and you're called Awakened to Power. That makes us members of the same sect in the Buddhist faith."
"Master," said Pig, "I have been instructed by the Bodhisattva and I never eat the five stinking foods and the
three forbidden meats−−wild goose, dog, and snakehead. I've eaten vegetarian food in my father−in−law's
house and never touched the stinking foods; but now that I have met you, master, I'm freed from these
restrictions."
"You are not," Sanzang replied. "You are not to eat the five stinking foods and the three forbidden meats, and
I'm giving you another name: Eight Prohibitions, or Bajie."
"I shall obey my master's command," the moron happily replied, and from then on he was known as Zhu
Bajie, or Eight Prohibitions Pig.
Squire Gao was happier than ever to see that he had turned from evil to good, and he ordered his servants to
set out banquet with which to thank the Tang Priest. Pig went over to Squire Gao, tugged at his coat, and said,
"Sir, may my wife come out and pay her respects to these two gentlemen?"
"Brother," said Monkey with a laugh. "You've entered the church now and become a monk. Don't ever talk
about a wife again. Only Taoist priests can have families−−we Buddhist monks never marry. Let's all sit down
and eat a vegetarian meal, then we can set off early tomorrow morning on our journey to the West." Squire
Gao had the table and chairs set out and asked Sanzang take the seat of honour. Monkey and Pig sat on his left
and right, and all the relations sat below them. Squire Gao opened a pot of wine, from which he filled a cup
and poured a libation to Heaven and Earth before handing it to Sanzang.
"Frankly, sir," Sanzang said, "I have been a vegetarian from the womb, and have not consumed
strong−flavoured food since my earliest childhood."
"Venerable master, I know that you are a vegetarian," Squire Gao replied, "which is why I haven't pressed any
meat or strong−flavoured food upon you. But this wine is made from vegetable matter, so a cup of it will do
no harm."
"I don't drink either," Sanzang explained, "as alcohol is the first of the prohibitions of the priesthood."
"Master," pig hastily interjected, "I may be a vegetarian, but I haven't given up liquor."
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 281
"And although I haven't strong head for the stuff and can't finish a whole jar of it, I haven't given it up either,"
Monkey added.
"In that case you two had better drink some; but don't get drunk and ruin everything," said Sanzang. The pair
of them then took the first cup, after which everyone sat down again as the vegetarian dishes were brought in.
Words could not describe the flowing cups, the well−filled dishes, and the splendid food.
When master and disciples had eaten, Squire Gao brought pieces of gold and silver to the weight of two
hundred ounces on a red lacquer tray and offered them to the three pilgrims to help with the expenses of their
journey. Then he produced three brocade−collared gowns that could serve as overcoats. "We are mendicant
monks," said Sanzang, "Who beg for our food in the villages and other places through which we pass, so we
could not possibly accept gold, silver, or cloth."
Monkey then marched up and grabbed a handful of the money. Then he addressed the young man Gao Cai.
"Yesterday," he said, "I troubled you to lead my master here, and today he has recruited another disciple, but
we have been unable to show our gratitude. So take these pieces of gold and silver as your fee for guiding us,
and buy yourself a pair of straw sandals. If you have any more evil spirits in future, and you help us again,
we'll be able to show even more appreciation." The young man Gao Cai took the gold and silver, then
kowtowed to express his thanks.
"If you won't take gold or silver," Squire Gao said, "please be good enough to accept these rough clothes as a
mark of our gratitude."
"If we monks accepted a single thread, we would have to atone for it for a thousand ages," replied Sanzang.
"It will suffice if we take the pancakes and fruit that we haven't eaten with us as provisions for the journey."
"Master, elder brother," said Pig, who was standing beside them, "it's all right for you two to refuse them, but
I was a son−in−law in this family for several years, and I deserves three bushels of grain to take with me. On
yes, father−in−law, my tunic was torn by elder brother yesterday and my shoes have split, so please give me a
black brocade cassock and a good pair of new shoes." Old Squire Gao, who could scarcely refuse this request,
gave him the new shoes and a tunic in exchange for his old ones.
Pig swaggered over to Old Gao, chanted a "na−a−aw" of respect, and said, "Please inform my mother−in−law,
my sisters−in−law, my brothers−in−law, and my uncles that I have become a monk today, and ask them to
excuse me for not saying good−bye to them in person. Father−in−law, look after my wife well. If we don't get
the scriptures, I'll go back to lay life and work for you as a son−in−law again."
"Moron," shouted Monkey, "stop talking nonsense."
"I'm doing nothing of the sort," Pig replied, "I am thinking that if things go wrong I'd be wasting my time as a
monk, and my wife's marriage would have been ruined, both for nothing."
"Enough of your idle chatter," said Sanzang, "let's be on our way at once." Their luggage was hung from a
carrying−pole on pig's shoulders. When the white horse was saddled, Sanzang mounted it, and Monkey led
the way with his iron cudgel over his shoulder. Thus the three of them left Squire Gao, his relations, and his
friends, and headed West. There is a pome to prove it that goes:
The trees tower above the misty earth
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 282
As the Tang disciples of Buddha toil and suffer.
When hungry, they beg their food from a thousand homes;
When cold they wear cloaks with a thousand patches.
Do not allow the Thought−horse to run wild,
And don't let the stubborn Mind−ape howl at will.
With passions stilled and one's nature firm, all destinies are in harmony;
When the full moon of contemplation is reached, you will be pure.
After travelling peacefully Westwards for a month, the three of them left the territory of Stubet and saw a
mountain soaring up above their heads. Sanzang stopped whipping his horse on, reined him in, and said,
"Monkey, Monkey, that's a high mountain in front of us, so please go and reconnoiter it."
"No need," said Pig. "It's called Pagoda Mountain, and there's a Rook's Nest Hermit who cultivates his
conduct on it. I've met him."
"What does he do?" Sanzang asked.
"He has some powers," Pig replied. "He once invited me to cultivate my conduct with him, but I didn't go." As
master and disciples talked they were soon on the mountain. It was a splendid mountain at that:
South of it were blue pines and verdant locust trees,
To the North were green willows and red peach−blossom.
Cawing noisily,
The wild birds talked to each other;
Soaring gracefully,
The cranes flew together.
Rich in fragrance
Were the thousands of different flowers;
Softly dark
Were the endless kinds of herbs.
In the gullies were bubbling green streams,
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 283
The crags were wreathed in auspicious cloud.
It was indeed a scene of rare and elegant beauty.
Lonely, where no man came or went.
As the master surveyed the scene from his horse he noticed a grass hut in front of a fragrant locust tree. To the
left of it were David's−deer with flowers in their mouths, and to the right were monkeys holding offerings of
fruit, while phoenixes of many colours wheeled around the top of the tree, in which cranes and golden
pheasants had gathered. Pig pointed and said, "That's the Rook's Nest Hermit." Sanzang gave his horse the
rein, whipped it on, and went straight to the foot of the tree.
When the hermit saw the three of them coming he jumped down from his bird's nest. Sanzang dismounted and
bowed to him, and only then the hermit reply, helping him up, "Please arise, holy priest. I'm sorry I did not
welcome you properly."
"Greetings, venerable hermit," said Pig.
"Aren't you the Iron−haired Pig from the Mount of Blessing? How have you had the great good fortune of
travelling with a holy monk?"
"Last year," replied Pig, "I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and I swore that I'd go with him as his
disciple."
"Wonderful, wonderful," exclaimed the delighted hermit, who then pointed at Monkey and asked, "Who is
this gentleman?"
"Old hermit," said Monkey, "how is it that you know him but didn't recognize me?"
"Please excuse my ignorance," the hermit replied.
"He is Sun Wukong, the senior of my disciples," explained Sanzang.
"I apologize for my discourtesy," said the hermit.
Sanzang bowed again and asked him the way to the Great Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven. "Far
away," the other replied, "far away. The journey is a long one and there are many tigers and leopards along
the way. It will be difficult."
"How far is it?" asked Sanzang with great interest. "Although the journey is a long one," the hermit replied,
"you are bound to get there in the end. But there will be evil influences that you'll find hard to dispel. I have a
Heart Sutra, a total of 270 words in 54 sentences, and if you recite it when you encounter evil influences you
will come to no harm." Sanzang prostrated himself on the ground and begged the hermit to tell him it, and the
hermit recited it to him. It went:
When the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was meditating on the profound prajna−paramita, he perceived that all
the five aggregates are void and empty, and he was thereupon freed from all sufferings and calamities.
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 284
Sariputra, matter is not different from voidness and voidness is not different from matter: matter is voidness
and voidness is matter. Such is also the case with sensation, perception, discrimination and consciousness.
Sariputra, all these things are void in nature, having neither beginning nor end, being neither pure nor impure,
and having neither increase nor decrease. Therefore, in voidness there is not matter, no sensation, no
perception, no discrimination and no consciousness; there is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body and
no mind; there is no sight, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch and no mental process; there is no category
of eye nor is there a category of consciousness; no ignorance nor the cessation of ignorance; no old age and
death, nor the cessation of old age and death; there is no suffering, no causes of suffering, no cessation of
suffering, and no way leading go the cessation of suffering; and there is no wisdom, nor anything to be gained.
As nothing is to be gained, a Bodhisattva depending on prajna−paramita becomes free in his mind, and as he
is free in his mind he has no fear and is rid of dreamlike thoughts of unreality and enjoys ultimate Nirvana. By

anuttara−samyak−sambodhi. Therefore, we know prajna−paramita is a great, divine spell, a great enlightening
spell, a supreme spell, and a spell without a parallel, that can do away with all sufferings without fail. Thus we
recite the Prajna−paramita Spell and say: Gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi, svaha!
As the Patriarch from the Tang had already the origins of enlightenment inside himself, he was able to
remember the Heart Sutra after only one hearing, and it has been passed on down to this very day. This sutra
is the kernel of the cultivation of the truth, and it is the gateway to becoming a Buddha. When the hermit had
recited it, he started to rise up to his crow's nest by cloud, but Sanzang tugged at him and said that he wanted
to know about the way to the Western Heaven. To this the hermit replied with a smile:
"The journey will not be difficult,
If you try to follow my instructions.
There will be a thousand mountains, a thousand deep rivers.
Many evil miasmas, and many a devil.
If you reach the edge of the sky
Do not worry or be afraid.
If you come to Precipitous Cliff
Walk with your feet placed sideways.
Be careful in the Black Pine Forest,
Where many an evil fox may block your path.
The capital cities will be full of spirits,
And demon kings will live in the mountains.
Tigers will sit in the music rooms,
Journey to the West
Chapter 19 285
Wolves will be in charge of the accounts.
Lions and elephants will all be kings,
With tigers and leopards for ministers.
A wild boar will carry your luggage,
A water monster will lead the way.
A very old stone monkey
Has no cause to be angry.
Ask those friends of yours−−
They know the way to the West."
Monkey smiled bitterly and said, "Let's go. No need to ask him; you can ask me." Sanzang did not understand
what he meant. The hermit changed himself into a beam of golden light and went up to his nest, while the
venerable Sanzang bowed to him in gratitude. Monkey, now furiously angry, raised his iron cudgel and was
just going up to wreck the place when ten thousand lotus flowers appeared, protected by a thousand
miraculous mists. Brother Monkey, you are strong enough to stir up the ocean or turn a river upside−down;
but don't even dream of touching a twig of that nest! When Sanzang saw what he was going to do, he grabbed
hold of him and said, "Wukong, what do you mean by trying to wreck this Bodhisattva's nest?"
"He insulted us two disciples," Monkey replied.
"He did not insult you," said Sanzang. "He was talking about the way to the Western Heaven."
"You wouldn't be able to understand," Monkey said. "When he said, 'A wild boar will carry your luggage,' he
was insulting Pig; and 'A very old stone monkey' was an insult to me. You didn't get his meaning, of course."
"Don't be angry," said Pig. "That hermit knows about the past and the future as well. We don't yet know
whether his talk about a water monster leading the way will come true or not. Let him off."
Monkey saw the lotus blossoms and the miraculous mists draw in round the nest, and could but ask his master
to mount the horse and go down the mountain to the West. On this journey,
Although they knew blessings rare on earth,
There was many a demon and disaster in the hill.
If you don't know what lay in store for them, listen to the explanation in the next installment.

The Tang Priest Meets Trouble on the Yellow Wind Ridge

The Dharma is born in the mind,
And in turn is destroyed by the mind.
Who do life and death come from?
Decide for yourself.
If it is all from your own mind,
Why do you need others to tell you?
All you need to do is work hard,
Squeezing blood out of iron.
Thread a silken rope through your nose.
And fasten yourself to emptiness.
Tie it to the tree of non−action,
To prevent it from collapsing.
Don't acknowledge bandits as your sons,
Or you will forget the Dharma and the mind.
Do not allow yourself to be deceived by others−−
Smash them first with a punch.
When the mind appears it is non−existent,
When the Dharma appears, it ceases.
When the boy and the ox both disappear,
The blue sky is absolutely clear.
All is as round as an autumn moon,

And this and that can no longer be distinguished.
This gatha refers to how the Patriarch Xuanzang came to awareness and understanding of the Heart Sutra and
thus opened the gate. As that venerable elder recited it constantly, a ray of miraculous light penetrated through
to him.
Eating and sleeping in the open, the three of them traveled on, and before long the heat of summer was upon
them.
The blossoms were over, the butterflies' passion spent.
High in the trees the cicadas screeched.
Wild silkworms spun cocoons amid the pomegranate blossom,
As lotus flowers opened in the pool.
As they were travelling along one evening they saw a cottage beside the road. "Look," said Sanzang, "the sun
is setting behind the Western hills, hiding its mirror of fire, and the moon is rising from the Eastern sea to
show its wheel of ice. How lucky that there is a family living by our path. Let's spend the night here and set
off again tomorrow morning."
"Well said," put in Pig. "I'm a bit hungry, and if we begged some food from that house I'd have more strength
for carrying the luggage."
"Homesick ghost," remarked Brother Monkey, "you've only been away from home for a few days, but you're
already regretting that you came."
"Elder brother," Pig replied, "I can't live on wind and mist like you. You couldn't realize how the hunger's
been gnawing at my stomach all these days I've been following our master."
"Pig," said Sanzang, "if your heart is still at home, you are not intended for a religious life, and you'd better go
back."
The oafish Pig fell to his knees and pleaded, "Master, please don't pay any attention to what my elder brother
says: it's an insult. He says I wish I hadn't come, but in fact I've had no regrets at all. I may be stupid, but I'm
straight. I just said that I was hungry and want to beg for some food, and he starts calling me a homesick
ghost. But the Bodhisattva told me about the prohibitions, and you have been so kind to me; so I really do
want to serve you on your journey to the West. I'll never have any regrets, I swear I won't. This is what they
call 'cultivating conduct the hard way'. What right have you to say I shouldn't be a monk?"
"Very well then," said Sanzang, "up you get."
The idiot leapt up, and picked up the carrying−pole, chattering incessantly. Then he pressed grimly on. Before
long they reached the roadside house, where Sanzang dismounted as Monkey took the bridle and Pig put
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 288
down his burden. They all stood in a green shade. Sanzang took his nine−ringed monastic staff, straightened
his rattan hat, and hurried to the gates, where he saw an old man lying back on a bamboo bed mumbling
Buddhist scriptures to himself.
Not wanting to shout loudly, Sanzang said in a quiet voice, "Greetings, benefactor."
The old man sprang to his feet, straightened his clothes, and came out through the gate to return his greeting.
"Excuse my discourtesy, venerable sir," he said, going on to ask, "Where are you from, and why have you
come to my humble abode?"
"I am a monk from the Great Tang in the East," Sanzang replied, "and I bear an imperial command to worship
the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and ask for the scriptures. As we find ourselves in this district at
nightfall, I would be enormously obliged if you could allow us to spend the night in your mansion."
"You'll never get there," said the old man with a wave of his hand and a shake of his head. "It's impossible to
get scriptures from the Western Heaven. If you want scriptures you'd better go to the Eastern Heaven."
Sanzang said nothing as he asked himself why the old man was telling them to go East when the Bodhisattva
had instructed them to go West. How could the scriptures be obtained in the East, he asked himself. In his
embarrassment he was at loss for words, so he made no reply.
Monkey, who was rough by his very nature, could not stand for this, so he went up to the old man and
shouted, "Old fellow, you may be very ancient but you're a complete fool. We holy men from far away come
to ask for lodging, but all you can do is to try to put us off. If your house is too poky and there isn't room for
us to sleep in it, we'll sit under the trees all night and won't trouble you any further." The old man grabbed
hold of Sanzang and said, "Master, you didn't warn me that you had a disciple with such a twisted face and no
chin to speak of, looking like a thunder god with his red eyes. You shouldn't let a demon of sickness like him
alarm and offend a person of my age."
"You're completely lacking in judgement, old man," Monkey said with a laugh. "Those pretty boys may look
good but, as they say, they don't taste good. I may be little but I'm tough, and it's all muscle under my skin."
"I suppose you must have some powers," the old man remarked.
"Without wishing to boast," Monkey replied, "I can get by."
"Where is your home," the old man asked, "and why did you shave your head and become a monk?"
"My ancestral home is the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai
which lies across the sea to the East of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. I learned how to be an evil
monster from childhood, and my name was Wukong, or Awakened to Emptiness. I used my abilities to make
myself the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, but as I declined heavenly office and raised a great rebellion against
the Heavenly Palace, I brought a disaster down on my own head. My sufferings are now over. I've turned to
the Buddhist faith and am seeking a good reward for the future by escorting His Tang Excellency, my master,
on his journey to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha. I'm not afraid of high mountains with precipitous
paths, or of broad rivers with huge waves. I can catch monsters and subdue demons, capture tigers or dragons,
walk in the sky, or burrow into the earth. As long as your mansion has a few broken bricks and tiles, a singing
pot and an open door, I'll be able to rest here contented."
After hearing this speech, the old man said with a chuckle, "So you're a monk with the gift of the gab who
suddenly switched destinies."
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 289
"You're the gabber, my child," retorted Monkey. "I'm too tired after the strain of the journey with my master
to be able to talk."
"It's as well you are," the old man replied, "or you'd be talking me to death. If you have all these powers you'll
be able to reach the West. How many of you are there? Please come into my cottage for the night."
"Thank you very much for not losing your temper with him," Sanzang said. "There are three of us."
"Where is the third?" the old man asked.
"Your eyes are very dim, old man," said Monkey, pointing as he continued, "Can't you see him standing in the
shade there?"
When the old man, whose eyes were indeed dim, looked carefully and saw Pig's face he was so terrified that
he ran into the house shouting, "Shut the gates, shut the gates, there's a monster here."
Monkey ran after him and grabbed him. "Don't be afraid, old fellow," he said, "he's not an evil monster, he's a
fellow−disciple of mine."
"Very well then," replied the old man, who was trembling all over, "but what a hideous creature to be a
monk."
As the old man was talking to the three monks in front of the gates, two young men appeared at the Southern
end of the farm bringing an old woman and three or four children back from transplanting rice−seedlings, for
which reason their clothes were tucked up and their feet were bare.
When they saw the white horse and the carrying pole with luggage and heard the shouting at the gates of their
home, they did not know what was up, so they rushed forward and asked, "What are you doing?" Pig turned
round, flapped his ears, and thrust his snout at them, at which they all collapsed in terror or fled.
In the confusion Sanzang kept calling out, "Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, we are good men, we are monks
going to fetch the scriptures." The old man then came out again, and helped the old woman to her feet.
"Up you get, wife," he said, "there's no call for panic. This holy father is from the Tang court, and although
his disciples are a bit ugly, their hearts are in the right place. Please take the youngsters inside." The old
woman clung to the old man while the two young men took the children inside.
As he sat on a bamboo chair in the gatehouse, Sanzang said indignantly, "Disciples, the pair of you are ugly to
look at, and your language is too coarse. You gave that whole family a terrible fright, and got me into
trouble."
"I tell you truthfully, master," Pig replied, "that I've grown better−looking since I've been following you.
When I lived in Gao Village I looked so awful that I often used to scare twenty or thirty people to death by
making a face and waggling my ears."
"Don't exaggerate, stupid," said Monkey with a smile, "and tidy that ugly mug of yours up a bit."
"What nonsense you're talking, Monkey," said Sanzang. "He was born that way, so how can you expect him
to tidy his face up?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 290
"He could stick his rake of a snout into his chest, and not bring it out; and he could lay those fan−shaped ears
down behind his head and not waggle them. That would tidy his appearance up." Pig then tucked his snout
away and laid his ears back, and stood beside Sanzang with his head bowed. Brother Monkey took the
luggage inside and tethered the white horse to a post.
The old man came out again with a young man who was carrying a tray with three cups of tea on it, and when
it had been drunk he gave instructions for a vegetarian meal to be prepared. The young man then brought out
an old, dented, and unlacquered table, as well as a pair of benches with chipped tops and broken legs, which
he put in a cool spot before asking the three of them to sit down. Sanzang then asked the old man his surname,
and was told, "Your humble servant's surname is Wang."
"How many descendants have you?"
"Two sons and three grandchildren."
"Congratulations, congratulations," said Sanzang; then he asked the old man how old he was.
"I have lived in my stupidity to sixty−one."
"Splendid, splendid, you have begun a new cycle," said Sanzang. "Benefactor," he continued, "why did you
say at first that it would be impossible to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven?"
"There is no problem about actually getting the scriptures," the old man replied, "it's just that the journey will
be very difficult. Only some twelve miles to the West of here is a mountain called the three−hundred mile
Yellow Wind Ridge, and it's full of evil monsters. That's why I said it would be impossible to get the
scriptures. But as this younger gentleman says he has so many magic powers, you will be able to get there."
"Certainly, certainly," said Monkey. "With me, my master and my fellow−disciple, no devils, however fierce,
will dare to provoke us."
As he spoke the youth came in with food, which he put on the table with the words, "Please eat." Sanzang put
his hands together and started to recite the grace. By then Pig had already swallowed a bowlful, and the moron
finished three more before the short prayer was over.
"What a chaff−guzzler," said Monkey. "We do seem to have run into a hungry ghost."
Old Wang, however, found the speed at which Pig ate very amusing, and said, "This reverend gentleman must
be very hungry. Give him more rice at once." The stupid creature indeed had a large stomach. Look at him,
keeping his head down as he devours at least a dozen bowls. Sanzang and Monkey had not been able to finish
two bowls, but the idiot would not stop and was still eating. "As this is far from being haute cuisine, I cannot
press you too hard, but please take another mouthful."
"We have eaten enough," said Sanzang and Monkey; but Pig said, "What are you going on about, old fellow?
Who's been telling your fortune? Is that why you're going on about quizzing? Anyhow, as long as there's rice,
give me some more." In a single meal the idiot ate all the rice in the house, and still said that he was only
half−full. Then the table was cleared away, bamboo beds were set out for them in the gatehouse, and they
went to sleep.
At dawn the next morning Monkey went to saddle the horse while Pig packed the luggage. Old Wang told his
wife to prepare some pastries and hot water for then, after which the three of them thanked him and said
good−bye. "If anything goes wrong on your journey," the old man said, "you must come to our place."
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 291
"Don't be so discouraging, old fellow," said Monkey. "We're dedicated, and there's no turning back for us."
With that they whipped the horse, picked up the carrying−pole, and headed West.
Alas! On their journey there was no good path to the West, and there were undoubtedly demons and great
disasters in store for them. Before they had been going for half a day, they reached the mountain. It was most
precipitous. Sanzang rode as far as the edge of a cliff, then dismounted to have a look.
High was the mountain,
Craggy the ridge;
Steep the cliffs,
Deep the valleys.
Springs could be heard,
And sweet smelt the flowers.
Was that mountain high?
Its summit touched the azure heavens.
Were the gorges deep?
At their bottom you could see the Underworld.
In front of the mountain
Were rolling white clouds,
And towering crags.
There were no end of myriad−fathom, soul−snatching cliffs,
In which were twisting caves for dragons,
Caves full of stalactites dripping with water.
He saw deer with branching antlers,
And river−deer gazing with fixed stare,
Coiled, red−scaled pythons,
And mischievous, white−faced apes.
At evening tigers climbed the hills to find their dens;
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 292
Dragons emerged from the waves at dawn,
To enter their caves with thunderous roars.
Birds flying in the grass
Rose in a flurry;
Beasts walking in the woods
Hurried helter−skelter.
Suddenly a pack of wolves ran past,
Making the heart pound hard with fear.
This is a place where caves are linked with caves,
And mountains stand with mountains.
The green of the peak made it like ten thousand feet of jade,
As a myriad clouds were piled above it like a cover of bluish gauze.
While Sanzang urged his silvery steed slowly forward, Monkey strolled ahead on his cloud and Pig ambled
along with the carrying−pole. As they looked at the mountain they heard a whirlwind blowing up, and
Sanzang was alarmed.
"Wukong," he said, "there's a whirlwind coming."
"What's there to be afraid of about a wind?" said Monkey. "It's only weather, after all, and nothing to be
scared of."
"But this is a very evil wind, not like a natural wind at all," Sanzang replied.
"How can you tell?" Monkey asked.
"Just look at it," said Sanzang:
"Mighty and majestic it howls and roars,
Coming out of the distant heavens.
As it crosses the ridge the trees moan,
The trunks bend when it enters the wood.
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 293
"The willow on the bank is shaken to its roots,
And flowers and leaves go swirling round the garden.
On the fishing boats gathering in nets, they pull hard on the cables;
Ships lower their sails, and all cast anchor.
"The traveler loses his way in mid−journey,
The woodcutter in the hills cannot carry his load.
The monkeys scatter in the orchards of fairy fruit,
The deer flee from the clumps of rare flowers.
"Locust trees and cedars collapse before the cliff,
While pine and bamboo in the valley are stripped of leaves.
There are stinging blasts of dirt and sand,
And waves boil on rivers and seas."
Pig went up to Monkey and grabbed hold of him. "Brother," he said, "this is a terrific storm. Let's take
shelter."
"You're useless, brother," replied Monkey with a mocking laugh. "If a big wind makes you want to hide, what
are you going to do when you meet an evil spirit?"
"Elder brother, have you never heard the saying, 'Avoid a pretty girl as you would an enemy, avoid a wind as
you would an arrow?'" Pig replied. "There's no reason why we shouldn't take shelter."
"Stop talking, will you, while I get a hold on that wind and take a sniff at it," said Monkey.
"You're talking through your hat again," said Pig with a grin. "As if you could get a hold on a wind. Besides,
even if you did, your hand would go through it."
"What you don't know, brother, is that I have a magic way of catching winds," Monkey replied. Letting the
head of the wind pass, the splendid Monkey grabbed the tail and sniffed at it. It had rather a foul stench. "It
certainly isn't a good wind," he remarked. "It smells like either a tiger wind or a monster wind. There's
definitely something suspicious about it."
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 294
Before the words were out of his mouth, a ferocious striped tiger leapt out at the foot of the slope, slashing
with its tail and rushing towards them. Sanzang was so scared that he could no longer keep his seat in his
carved saddle, but fell headfirst off his white horse and lay sprawled in a witless heap beside the path.
Pig threw down the luggage, grabbed his rake and, not letting Monkey move forward, roared, "Animal, where
d'you think you're going?" He went straight after it and smote it on the head. The tiger stood up on its hind
legs, and with a swing of its front left claws ripped at its own chest. There was a tearing noise as its skin all
came off, and then the creature stood beside the path. Just see how hideous was:
A gory, skinned body,
Round, red legs and feet.
Fiery, matted hair,
And straight, bristling eyebrows.
Four sinister steely white fangs,
A pair of glittering golden eyes.
With soaring spirits it gave a mighty roar,
A mighty and majestic shout.
"Not so fast," it yelled, "not so fast. I am none other than the Commander of the Vanguard for the Great
Yellow Wind King. I bear His Majesty's strictest command to patrol the mountain and catch a few common
mortals as tidbits for him to nibble with his wine. Where are you from, monk, and how dare you wound me
with that weapon of yours?"
"I'll get you, you beast," replied Pig abusively. "You don't seem to realize that I'm not just any old passing
traveler: I'm a disciple of Sanzang, the younger brother of the Tang Emperor of the East, who has been sent by
the Emperor to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scriptures. If you clear off, stop
blocking our path, and don't frighten my master any more, I'll spare your life. But if you go on raging about
like that, there'll be no mercy for you."
Not bothering to argue, the evil spirit rushed at Pig, feinted, and clawed at his face. Pig dodged nimbly and
swung his rake at the monster, who turned and fled as he was unarmed. With Pig at his heels he made for the
bottom of the slope and produced two bronze swords from the tangled undergrowth there; then, brandishing
them, he turned to face Pig. The two of them battled away at the foot of the hill, lunging and hitting at each
other. Monkey, who was helping the Tang Priest to sit up, said, "Don't be afraid, master. You sit here while I
help Pig to defeat that monster, then we can be on our way." Sanzang, who had managed to sit up, was
shaking all over and intoning the Heart Sutra.
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 295
Monkey grabbed his cudgel and shouted, "Get it." Pig made a tremendous effort, and the monster fled from
the scene of battle. "Don't let him get away," yelled Monkey, "you must catch it." The pair of them chased the
monster down the mountain, waving the rake and the cudgel. The monster was so hard−pressed that it did a
"golden cicada shedding its skin" trick. It reverted to its real form−−a ferocious tiger−−with a somersault, but
Monkey and Pig would still not let it get away, and were hot on its heels, determined to destroy it. When the
monster saw how close they were, it ripped at its chest and tore off its skin again, then laid it over a rock that
was shaped like a crouching tiger. Then it abandoned its real body, turned into a hurricane, and went straight
back to the path, where it noticed Sanzang reciting the Heart Sutra. Sanzang was grabbed by the monster and
carried away on the wind. Poor Sanzang:
The Monk of the River was fated to suffer much;
In the faith of Nirvana it is hard to win merit.
Carrying the Tang Priest to the mouth of the cave, the monster stilled the hurricane and said to the
gatekeepers, "Report to His Majesty at once that the Tiger of the Vanguard has caught a monk and is awaiting
further instructions outside the gates." He was then admitted on the orders of the chieftain. With his two
bronze swords stuck in his belt and holding the Tang Priest in both hands, he went forward and genuflected
before the chieftain. "Your Majesty," he said, "your humble underling was patrolling the mountain as ordered
when suddenly I met a monk. He is the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of His Majesty the Great Tang
Emperor, and he was going to the West to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. I have captured him and
now offer him as a dish for your table."
The chieftain was astonished at the news. "I've heard tell of the Patriarch Sanzang, the holy priest sent by the
Great Tang Emperor to fetch the scriptures. He has a disciple called Brother Monkey whose magical powers
are tremendous and whose cunning is considerable. However did you manage to catch him?"
"He has two disciples. The first one to come at me was a fellow with a long nose and big ears who wields a
nine−pronged rake, and the second one has a gold−banded iron cudgel and fiery eyes with golden pupils.
When the pair of them were after me and about to attack, I used a 'golden cicada shedding its skin' trick to
make my getaway, then I caught this monk to offer to Your Majesty as a snack."
"He's not to be eaten yet," the chieftain said.
"You must be off your food, Your Majesty, if you won't eat what's put before you," said the Tiger of the
Vanguard.
"You don't get my point," the chieftain replied. "It's not eating him that worries me, but the thought that those
two disciples of his may come here to make trouble, which would be dangerous. Tie him to the wind−settling
stake in the garden at the back, and leave him there for a few days till we're sure his disciples won't be coming
to make trouble for us. This way he'll be nice and clean, and we can do what we like with him without any
arguments. Whether we have him boiled, steamed, fried or scrambled, we can eat him at our leisure."
"Your Majesty's plans are most far−sighted, and you are quite right," said the Tiger of the Vanguard, who then
ordered his underlings to take Sanzang away.
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 296
Seven or eight of them crowded forward to tie up Sanzang and take him away; they were like hawks seizing
bramblings as they bound him tightly. Then did the unfortunate Monk of the River long for Brother Monkey;
the holy priest in his troubles wished Pig would come.
"Disciples," he called out, "I don't know on what mountain you are catching monsters, or where you're
subduing evil spirits, but I've met with disaster and been captured by a demon. Alas, when will I ever see you
again? If you come soon, you can save my life, but if you are too long about it I will be finished." His tears
poured down like rain as he moaned and sighed.
As Monkey and Pig chased the tiger down the mountain side they saw that it had reached the bottom and was
crouching at the foot of the cliff. Monkey raised his cudgel and brought it down as hard as he could, thus
hurting his own hands. Pig took another swipe at the beast with his rake, which made its prongs splay apart.
The Tiger turned out to be only a tiger skin spread over a rock shaped like crouching tiger.
"This is terrible," said Monkey, "he's tricked us."
"How?" Pig asked.
"The trick is called 'the golden cicada shedding its skin'. He put his tiger−skin over this rock and got away.
We'd better go back and see that our master comes to no harm." The two of them rushed back to find that
Sanzang had disappeared. "Whatever shall we do?" cried Monkey in a voice as loud as thunder. "It's caught
our master."
Pig led the horse over and said through his tears, "Heaven help us. Wherever shall we look for him?"
"Don't cry," said Monkey, raising his head, "don't cry. If you cry you'll dampen our spirits. I'm convinced he
must be somewhere on this mountain. We must start searching for him."
The two of them hurried deep into the mountain, going through passes and crossing ridges, and after they had
been going for a long time they saw a cave palace at the foot of a rock−face. They stopped to gaze at it, and
saw an awe−inspiring sight:
Screened by many a jagged peak,
With ancient paths winding around;
Green pines merged with bluish bamboo;
The softness of willows and wutong trees.
Odd boulders stood in pairs before the cliff,
While birds made couples hidden in the woods.
The water in the gully splashed against the rock−wall,
As the spring waters trickled over the sandbank.
Under the billowing clouds,
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 297
Rare herbs grew lush.
Fox spirits and crafty hares darted around;
Horned deer and river−deer fought for mastery.
Ancient creepers hung across the rocks,
And a thousand−year cypress was suspended in a chasm.
In pinnacled majesty it vied with Mount Hua;
The flowers and birdsong rivaled Tiantai Peak.
"Worthy brother," said Monkey, "put our baggage in the wind−storing cave, let the horse out to pasture, and
lie low while I go to the gates of that place and fight it out with them. I must catch that evil spirit before I can
rescue our master."
"There's no need to give me instructions," Pig replied. "Go at once."
Monkey straightened his tunic, tightened his tiger−skin kilt, and went straight to the gate with his cudgel in
his hands. Above the gate he saw YELLOW WIND CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND RIDGE written in
large letters. Taking a firm stance and brandishing the club he shouted, "Evil monsters, send my master out if
you don't want this den of yours turned upside−down and your home trampled flat."
When the junior fiends heard this they were terrified, and they ran trembling inside to announce, "Your
Majesty, a disaster."
"What is it?" asked the Yellow Wind Monster who was sitting inside.
"There's a thunder−voiced, hairy−faced monk outside with a great thick iron cudgel in his hands, and he wants
his master back," they said.
The alarmed chieftain sent for the Tiger of the Vanguard and said to him, "When I sent you to patrol the
mountain you were only supposed to catch mountain oxen, wild boar, deer, and goats. Why on earth did you
bring that Tang Priest here? It's provoked his disciple into coming to make trouble. What are we to do?"
"There is no need for Your Majesty to worry," the Tiger replied. "Your incompetent underling will take fifty
junior officers out with me and bring back that Brother Monkey as a second course for the meal."
"Apart from the higher and lower ranking commanders, we have about six hundred junior officers here," said
the chieftain. "Take as many of them as you like with you. If you catch that Monkey, we can dine off the
priest at our leisure, and I promise to make you my sworn brother. But I'm afraid that you won't be able to get
him, and that he'll kill you. If that happens, don't blame me."
"Rest assured," the tiger monster said, "rest assured. I'll soon be back with him." Mustering fifty strong and
spirited young fiends, he charged out of the gates with drums rolling and banners waving; his two bronze
swords were tied to his body. "Where are you from, ape monk?" he shrieked at the top of his voice. "What do
you mean by all this yelling and shouting?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 298
"You skinned beast," Monkey retorted, "you played that trick of skinning yourself to capture my master, and
you have the nerve to ask me what I'm doing! Bring my master out at once and I'll spare your life."
"Yes, I captured your master," the monster replied, "and he's going to be served up at His Majesty's dinner
table. If you have any sense, go away. Otherwise I'll catch you too, and you'll be served up with him. As I've
got one of you, I'll let the other off." Monkey was now furious, and he gnashed his steely teeth as his fiery
eyes opened wide in a terrible glare.
"What powers have you," he roared, brandishing his iron cudgel, "to give you the nerve to talk so big? Hold it
a moment, and take this." The tiger put his hands on his swords, and a terrible fight ensued as each of them
showed off his powers.
The monster was like a goose egg,
Monkey was an egg−shaped stone.
Trying to ward off Monkey with bronze swords
Was like throwing eggs at a stone.
How can a crow or jackdaw fight a phoenix?
What chance has a pigeon against a hawk?
The monster snorted out winds that covered the mountain with dust,
But Monkey breathed a fog that blotted out the sun.
After fighting it out for many a round,
The Vanguard was exhausted, his strength all gone.
He turned away, defeated, to flee for his life,
Only to have Monkey harry him to death.
When he could defend himself no longer, the monster turned to flee. As he had talked so boastfully in front of
his chieftain he dared not return to the cave, so he tried to escape up the mountain side. Monkey, who had no
intention of letting him go, chased him as fast as he could, waving his cudgel, roaring, and howling. He
chased him as far as the hollow where the wind was stored, where Pig could be seen pasturing the horse. As
soon as Pig heard the shouting he turned to look, and when he saw Monkey pursuing the defeated tiger
monster he let go of the horse, raised his rake, and struck the tiger diagonally across the head. The poor
monster, who thought he had made his way out of the silken net, never realized that he had been caught by a
fish−trapper. Pig's rake made nine holes from which the blood gushed, and the brains all spurted out. There is
a pome to prove it that goes:
Journey to the West
Chapter 20 299
Converted to the true faith several years before,
He avoided meat and was awakened to emptiness.
Determined with all his heart to defend Sanzang
He won this merit early in his religious life.
Planting his foot in the middle of the monster's back, Pig swung the rake with both hands and smote him
again. When Monkey saw this he was delighted, and he said, "That's the way, brother. He led a few dozen
petty fiends out to do battle with me, but I beat him. Instead of running back to the cave he came this way, as
if he wanted to die. If you hadn't been here to meet him, he'd have got away again."
"Was he the one who made a gale and carried off our master?" Pig asked.
"The very one," Monkey replied. "Did you ask him where our master is?" Pig asked.
"He took our master into the cave and wanted to give him to his chieftain to eat with his rice. This made me so
angry that I fought him all the way to here, where you finished him off. The credit for this must go to you,
brother. You'd better go on looking after the horse and our things while I drag that monster's body over to the
cave and challenge them to another fight. We must capture the chief monster if we're to rescue our master."
"You're right," said Pig, "so off you go. If you beat that chief monster, mind you chase him this way for me to
corner and kill." Splendid Monkey went straight to the mouth of the cave with his cudgel in one hand and the
dead tiger in the other. Indeed:
When the patriarch was in danger from evil monsters,
Emotion and Nature combined to subdue the demons.
If you don't know whether he defeated the evil monsters and saved Sanzang, listen to the explanation in the
next installment.
Chapter 21
The Protectors of the Faith Build a Farm for the Great Sage
Lingji from Sumeru Pacifies the Wind Devil
The fifty petty devils fled routed into the cave, their banners and drums smashed, to report, "Your Majesty,
the Tiger of the Vanguard is no match for the hairy−faced monk, who chased him down the mountain." The
old fiend was very angry at the news, and he sat silent with his head bowed as he thought over what to do.
Then the petty demons from the gate came in to announce, "Your Majesty, the hairy−faced monk has killed
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 300
the Tiger of the Vanguard and dragged his body to the gates, where he's insulting us to provoke us to fight."
The old fiend was angrier than ever when he heard this, and he said, "This wretch doesn't know what he's
doing, killing my Commander of the Vanguard although I haven't eaten his master. Hateful beast. Bring my
armour. I've heard of this Brother Monkey, and now I think I'll go out to have a look at this nine−headed,
eight−tailed monk. I'll capture him to avenge my Tiger of the Vanguard." The junior devils brought the
armour as fast as they could, and when the old fiend had put it all on properly, he took his steel trident and led
his devilish host out of the cave. He was full of martial dignity as he came out, and you can see how he was
equipped:
His golden helmet shone in the sun,
And light was reflected from his golden armour.
A pheasant's tail floated above his helmet,
And the thin silk robe over his armour was pale goose−yellow.
The belt that girded his armour was dragon−brilliant;
His shining breastplate dazzled the eye.
His deerskin boots
Were the color of locust−tree blossom;
His brocade kilt
Was patterned with willow leaves.
With a sharp steel trident in his hand,
He was no less awesome than the Little Sage Erlang.
As he came out of his cave the old fiend shouted at the top of his voice, "Are you Brother Monkey?"
Monkey, who was jumping up and down on the tiger monster's corpse and brandishing his cudgel, replied,
"Your grandfather, Monkey, is here. Send my master out." The evil spirit looked carefully at Monkey and saw
that he had a miserable little body and a pinched face, and did not even stand four feet tall.
"Poor little thing," he said with a laugh. "I'd imagined that you were some sort of invincible hero, but now I
see what a little sick devil you really are, all skin and bone."
Monkey smiled back and said, "You've no eyes in your head, my child. I may be tiny, but if you hit me on the
head with the handle of your trident, I'll grow another six feet."
"Make your head hard then," the monster replied, "here it comes."
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 301
The Great Sage did not flinch as the monster hit him, then with a bend of his waist he grew six feet taller,
making himself ten feet tall altogether, to the astonishment of the monster, who put his trident down and
shouted, "Brother Monkey, why do you come and do these defensive transformations at my gate? Stop fooling
around, and come over here so we can compare tricks."
"My child," Monkey replied, "as the saying goes, 'If you have any warm feelings, don't raise your hand in
anger; and if you raise your hand in anger, put all feelings aside.' I have a very heavy hand, and I'm afraid that
you may not be able to stand my cudgel." No longer wishing to talk, the monster whirled his trident round and
lunged at Monkey's chest. With unrushed expertise Monkey did a "Black Dragon Pawing the Ground"
movement to parry the trident with his cudgel before striking at the monster's head. There followed a fine duel
between the pair of them at the mouth of the Yellow Wind Gave:
The demon king was furious,
The Great Sage showed his might.
The furious demon king
Wanted to catch Monkey in revenge for his Vanguard Commander;
The mighty Great Sage
Intended to capture the evil spirit and rescue his master.
When the trident came the cudgel parried,
When the cudgel struck the trident blocked.
One was supreme commander of the mountain,
The other was the Handsome Monkey King, Protector of the Law.
At first they fought in the dust,
But then they rose into mid−air.
The steel−tipped trident
Was bright−pointed and deadly sharp;
The As−You−Will cudgel
Was black and banded with gold.
Whoever was run through would go to the Underworld;
If either was hit he would surely meet King Yama.
All depended on a fast hand and a quick eye;
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 302
Strength and vigor were essential.
Each was mindless of life or death,
Who would survive, and who would be killed?
After some thirty rounds of combat between the old fiend and the Great Sage the issue was still not settled. As
Monkey wanted to win glory he used an "extra body" trick: plucking a hair out, he chewed it into little bits,
blew them all out, and shouted, "Change!" They turned into well over a hundred Monkeys, all dressed like
him and wielding iron cudgels. They surrounded the monster in mid−air, and in his fright he countered with a
trick of his own. He turned his head sharply to the Southeast opened his mouth three times, and blew. A
yellow hurricane suddenly arose. It was really terrible.
As it howled and moaned all was changed;
Without sign or shadow the yellow dust whirled,
Whistling through forests, toppling mountains, and uprooting trees,
Picking up dust to blot out the tumbling ridge.
The Yellow River's waters were all in turmoil,
While the Yangtse's waves were blown backwards.
The Polar palace was rocked in the sky,
The Senluo Palace in the Underworld was all but blown down.
Heaven was filled with the shouting of Arhats,
The Eight Great Vajrapanis were all yelling wildly.
Manjusri's black−coated lion fled,
Samantabhadra's white elephant was nowhere to be found.
The True Martial Emperor's tortoise and snake were missing,
Zi Tong's mule was blown away by its saddle−cloth.
Travelling merchants called on Heaven,
Boatmen made vows to the gods as they sought safety.
Lives were washed away in the torrent,
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 303
Fortune or death was decided by the waters.
The cave palace on the magic mountain was murky dark,
And Penglai, island of joy, was wrapped in gloom.
Lao Zi could hardly manage to look after his furnace,
The Star of Longevity put away his fan of dragon's beard grass.
The Queen Mother, on her way to a Peach Banquet,
Had the pendants at her waist blown in a tangle.
Erlang could not find his city of Guanzhou;
Nezha could scarcely draw his sword from its scabbard.
Heavenly King Li lost sight of the pagoda in his hand,
Lu Ban the carpenter dropped his gold−tipped awl.
Three stories of the pagoda at Thunder Monastery fell,
And the stone bridge at Zhaozhou collapsed.
The red wheel of the sun sent out no light,
And all the stars in the sky were dimmed.
The birds of the Southern hills were carried to the North,
The waters of the East lake flowed to the West.
Husband was parted from wife,
Mother snatched from child.
The dragon king searched the seas for his yakshas,
The thunder god hunted everywhere for his lightning.
The Ten Kings of hell looked for the judge,
While the bull−headed demons searched for the horse−faced.
This hurricane overturned Potaraka Island,
Rolling up all of Guanyin's scriptures.
The white lotus went flying beyond the seas,
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 304
And the twelve courts of the Bodhisattva were all blown down.
Pan Gu, who had seen all winds since creation,
Had never seen one as fine as this,
Howl, howl−−
As mountains and seas trembled,
Heaven and Earth were all but blasted asunder.
The hurricane that the monster had summoned up made all the little Monkeys that the Great Sage had
produced from his hair whirl round in mid−air like so many spinning−wheels, and, far from being able to use
their cudgels, they could not even control their own bodies. At this critical moment Monkey shook his hair
and put it back on his body, then advanced to give battle with his iron cudgel held high. The monster blew
another yellow hurricane at him, and it was so strong that Monkey had to shut his fiery eyes with their golden
pupils tight. Opening them was out of the question. Unable to use his iron cudgel, he had to flee from the
scene of battle, at which the monster put his wind away and went back to his cave.
When Pig saw the great yellow hurricane blow up and cast Heaven and Earth into darkness, he held on to the
horse and kept a grip on the carrying pole while he crouched in the hollow on the mountain side, not daring to
open his eyes or raise his head as he invoked the Buddha and made all sorts of vows to him. He did not know
whether Monkey had won or lost, or whether their master was still alive. As he worried about all this the wind
died down and the sky became clear again. He raised his head to look towards the entrance of the cave, but he
could neither see any weapons nor hear any gongs or drums. The idiot did not want to get any nearer to those
gates, and there was nobody else to look after the horse and the baggage, so he was stuck there, not knowing
what to do, and feeling miserable. His gloomy thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Monkey shouting to
the West of him. Pig half rose to his feet to welcome him and said, "That was quite a wind, elder brother.
Where've you been?"
"That was terrible," said Monkey, "Never in my life have I known such a hurricane. That old fiend came out
to fight me with a steel trident, and after we'd been at it for thirty rounds I used my extra body trick to
surround him. This made him so worried that he deliberately summoned up the wind. It was really vicious−−it
blew so hard I couldn't stand my ground, so I had to put my tricks away and clear out. What a wind, what a
wind! I can call up wind or rain, but I've never produced anything as vicious as his."
"Can that evil monster fight well?" Pig asked.
"He's not bad at all," Monkey replied, "and he has a very neat way with this trident. We were evenly matched,
apart from that foul wind, which makes him unbeatable."
"Then how are we going to rescue our master?" Pig asked.
"His rescue will have to wait," Monkey replied. "I wonder if there's an oculist near here to treat my eyes."
"What's happened to them?" Pig asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 305
"When that monster blew his wind at me," said Monkey, "it made my eyes very sore, and they keep on
watering."
"We're halfway up a mountain, and night's falling," said Pig. "Never mind about an oculist, there's nowhere
for us to shelter for the night."
"There's no problem about shelter," Monkey replied. "I don't think that evil spirit will dare to do our master
any harm, so let's find the main path and look for a house to stay in tonight. We can come back here at first
light to subdue that fiend."
"Very well, very well," Pig replied.
Leading the horse and carrying the baggage, they came out of the hollow and went along the path. The dusk
was gradually deepening when they heard dogs barking under a hill to the South of the path. They stopped to
look and saw a farmhouse with a lamp shining brightly in its window. The pair of them stopped bothering to
look for the path and cut straight through the grass to the gate. They saw
Dark magic fungus,
Greeny white rocks.
The magic fungus was dark among the many herbs,
The white rocks were green with moss.
Some tiny fireflies made dots of light
Against the dense ranks of the forest trees.
Heavy was the fragrance of the orchid,
And the tender bamboo had been newly cut.
A pure spring flowed along a winding bed,
An ancient cypress hung over a cliff.
No travelers came to this remote spot,
And only wild flowers bloomed before the gate.
As they did not want to march straight in, the two of them shouted, "Open up, open up."
An old man came out at the head of several farm hands carrying forks, rakes and brooms. "Who are you," he
asked, "who are you?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 306
"We are the disciples of the holy priest of the Great Tang in the East," replied Monkey with a bow. "We were
crossing these mountains on our way to the West to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures when the Great
King of the Yellow Wind snatched our master away. We haven't been able to rescue him yet, but as it is
getting dark we have come to beg for a night's lodging in your mansion, and we hope very much that you will
help us."
The old man returned his bow and said, "I'm sorry I didn't welcome you properly. This is a place where we
see a lot of clouds but very few people, and when I heard you shouting at the gate I feared it might be
fox−spirits, tigers, bandits from the mountains, or something of the sort. I am afraid that I have stupidly
offended you: I did not realize it would be two reverend gentlemen. Please come in." Taking the horse and the
luggage with them they went inside, tethered the animal, put down the carrying pole, bowed to the old man,
and sat down. A servant came in with tea, and when they had drunk it some bowls of sesame meal were
produced. After they had eaten, the old man had beds prepared for them and suggested that they went to bed.
"We don't need to sleep yet," Monkey replied, adding, "may I ask you, kind sir, if eye ointment is sold
anywhere around here?"
"Do you have a chronic eye complaint, reverend sir?" the old man asked.
"I can tell you truthfully, sir," Monkey replied, "that we religious men have never been ill before, and I've
never had trouble with my eyes before."
"Then why are you asking for ointment?" the old man asked.
"We were trying to rescue our master on the Yellow Wind Ridge today," Monkey explained, "when that
monster started blowing his wind at me, which made my eyes ache. They're streaming with tears now, which
is why I want to find some eye ointment."
"A fine story," the old man commented. "How could you tell such lies, a reverend gentleman, and so young a
one at that? The Great King of the Yellow Wind's hurricane is really terrible. It can't be compared with spring
winds, autumn winds, pine and bamboo winds, or North, South, East and West winds."
"It must be a brain−snatching wind," interrupted Pig, "or a goat's ear wind, or a hemp wind, or a
head−twisting wind."
"No, no," the old man said, "it's called a Divine Samadhi Wind."
"What's it like?" Monkey asked.
"It can darken Heaven and Earth,
Make gods and devils gloomy,
Split rocks open and bring cliffs down,
And it doesn't stop till you're dead,"
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 307
the old man replied. "If you'd encountered that wind, you couldn't possibly have survived. Only a god or an
Immortal would be able to survive such a wind."
"Quite right," Monkey replied, "quite right. Although we're not gods or Immortals ourselves, I regard them as
my juniors, and this life of mine is extremely hard to snuff out−−all the wind could do was to make my eyes
very sore."
"If what you say is true," the old man said, "you must really be somebody. Although there is nowhere that
sells eye ointment here, I sometimes suffer from watering eyes myself when I'm in the wind, and I once met
an unusual person who gave me a prescription for 'Three Flower Nine Seed Ointment'. This cures all
inflammations of the eye."
Monkey bowed his head, chanted a respectful "na−a−aw," and said, "Please put a little on my eyes for me to
try." The old man consented, went inside, and brought out a tiny agate bottle. Removing the stopper, he
dipped a jade hairpin inside and put a tiny amount in Monkey's eyes, then told him not to open them. He could
go to sleep without worrying, and in the morning he would be cured. When he had finished applying it he put
the stopper back the bottle and gave it to a servant to put away inside. Pig opened their bundles, spread out
their bedding, and told Monkey to go to bed.
Monkey groped about so wildly with his eyes shut that Pig laughed at him and said, "Would you like a blind
man's stick, sir?"
"Chaff−guzzling moron," Monkey retorted, "do you want to make a blind man of me?" The idiot chuckled
himself quietly to sleep, but Monkey sat thinking on the bed until midnight before he dozed off.
At about five the next morning, just before the break of day, Brother Monkey rubbed his face, opened his eyes
and said, "It certainly is good ointment−−I can see far, and more clearly than ever." He turned round to look
behind him, and to his astonishment there was no house, windows, or doors; all that could be seen were some
ancient locust trees and tall willows. The pair of them were sleeping on cushions of green sedge.
"What are you shouting for?" asked Pig as he woke up.
"Open your eyes and look," replied Monkey. The idiot raised his head, and when he saw that there was
nobody there, he leapt up in a panic with the words, "Where's our horse?"
"Over there, tied to a tree," said Monkey.
"What about the luggage?"
"There, beside your head."
"The wretches," said Pig, "moving way in the middle of the night. Damn it, we must have been almost dead
asleep. However did they dismantle the house without us hearing a thing?"
"Idiot," said Monkey with a snigger, "don't go shouting all over the place. Can you see what that piece of
paper on the tree over there is?" Pig went over, tore it down, and saw that there were four lines of verse on it:
"This farm was not inhabited by mortals;
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 308
The Revealers of the Truth produced the house by magic.
I gave you good medicine to cure your eyes:
Subdue demons with all your heart, and never hesitate."
"So those tough gods came to play their tricks, although I haven't called the roll since they changed the dragon
into a horse," said Monkey.
"Don't show off, brother," said Pig. "How could they possibly answer to your roll−call?"
"You don't realize," Monkey replied, "that the Protectors of the Faith, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the
Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions and the Four Duty Gods have all been ordered by the Bodhisattva
to give secret protection to our master. They reported their names to me then, but as I've had you with me
recently I haven't needed them again, which is why I haven't called the roll."
"Brother," Pig replied, "if they have been ordered to protect our master in secret, then of course they can't
appear in their true forms. That was why they produced the magic farm. You mustn't be angry with them.
Yesterday they gave you eye ointment and fed us−−they did all they could. Don't be angry with them. Let's go
and rescue the master instead."
"How right you are," said Monkey. "It's not far from here to the Yellow Wind Cave, so there's no need for you
to move. You'd better stay in the wood and look after the horse and the luggage while I go to the cave to see
what I can find out about where our master is before fighting the monster again."
"Yes," said Pig, "find out for sure whether he's alive or dead. If the master's dead, we'd better each go our own
way, and if he's alive we'll do everything we can to save him."
"Stop talking such nonsense," replied Monkey. "I'm off."
With a single jump he arrived at the entrance to the cave, where the gates were still locked as everyone was
asleep. Monkey did not call on them to open the gates as he did not want to alarm the monsters. Instead he
said a spell, made a magic movement with his hand, shook himself, and turned into a neat little mosquito.
There are some lines about it that go:
Its troublesome little body has a sharp bite,
Its faint buzz echoes like thunder.
Clever at getting through the curtains round the bed,
It particularly loves the summer's warm weather.
It fears only smoke and fly−swatters,
And loves the brilliance of the lamp.
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 309
Light and tiny, it flies straight in,
Entering the evil spirit's cave.
Seeing that the lowly demon on the gate was fast asleep and snoring, Monkey bit him on the face, at which the
creature woke up and said, "My lord! What an enormous mosquito! It's raised a huge lump with a single bite."
Then he opened his eyes and announced, "It's light." The two gates creaked open, and Monkey flew inside
with a buzz to see the old demon giving orders that a very close watch was to be kept at all the gates, and all
the weapons are to be assembled at such−and−such a spot.
"I'm afraid that yesterday's wind may not have killed Brother Monkey," he was saying, "and I think he's bound
to come back today. When he does, I'll finish him off."
When he heard this, Monkey flew across to the back of the hall where he saw a door that was tightly closed.
He slipped through the crack between the two leaves of the door and found himself in a large empty garden,
on one side of which was the wind−settling stake with the Tang Priest tied to it. The tears were pouring down
Sanzang's face as he wondered where Monkey and Pig were. Monkey stopped flying as he stung his shaven
pate and called, "Master."
"Monkey," said Sanzang, recognizing his voice, "do you want to get me killed? Where are you calling me
from?"
"I'm on your head, master. Don't be anxious or worried. We are sure to catch that evil spirit and save your
life."
"How long will it be till you catch that evil spirit, disciple?"
"Pig has already killed the tiger monster who captured you," Monkey replied, "but that old fiend has a terrible
way with a hurricane. All the same, I'm certain that I can catch him today, so don't worry and stop crying. I'm
off now."
With those words he buzzed away to the front hall, where he saw the old monster sitting on his throne and
reviewing his captains. A junior evil spirit suddenly rushed in with a command flag in his hands and
announced, "I had just gone out to patrol the mountain, Your Majesty, when I saw a monk with a long snout
and big ears sitting in the woods. If I hadn't run as fast as I could, he'd have caught me. But I didn't see that
hairy−faced monk."
"If Brother Monkey wasn't there," the old fiend said, "he must have been killed by the wind, and he won't be
going off to get soldiers to rescue his master."
"If the wind killed him, Your Majesty," the other devils said, "we are in luck. But if he wasn't killed and went
to fetch divine soldiers instead, what's to be done?"
"What's so frightening about divine soldiers?" the old fiend said. "None of them can put down my wind except
the Bodhisattva Lingji, so there's no need to fear the rest of them."
When Monkey heard this as he sat on a roof−beam, he was beside himself with delight. Flying straight out, he
reverted to his real form and went back to the wood, calling, "Brother."
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 310
"Where have you been?" Pig asked. "I chased an evil spirit with a command flag away just now."
"Good for you," said Monkey with a smile, "good for you. I changed myself into a mosquito and went into the
cave to see our master. He was tied to a wind−settling stake in there and crying. I told him not to cry, flew up
to a roof−beam, and had a good listen. I saw the one with the command flag come puffing and panting in to
report that you'd chased him away and that he hadn't seen me. The old fined was making some wild guesses.
First he said that I had been killed by his wind, then he said I'd gone to ask for the help of divine soldiers. It's
wonderful−−he gave the fellow's name away."
"Whose name?" Pig asked.
"He said that no divine soldier could suppress his wind except the Bodhisattva Lingji," Monkey continued,
adding, "but I don't know where the Bodhisattva Lingji lives."
As they were wondering what to do, an old man came along the road. Look at him:
He was strong enough not to need a stick,
But his beard was like ice and his flowing hair snowy.
Although his gold−flecked sparkling eyes seemed somewhat dim,
His aged bones and muscles had not lost their strength.
Slowly he walked, back bent, and head bowed down,
But his broad brow and rosy cheeks were those of a boy.
If you gave him a name from his looks,
The Star of Longevity had come out of his cave.
When Pig saw him he said with delight, "Brother, you know the saying, 'If you want to know the way down
the mountain, ask a regular traveler.' Why don't you ask him?" The Great Sage put his iron cudgel away,
unhitched his clothes, and went up to the old man. "Greetings, grandfather," he said.
Half replying to him and half not, the old man returned his bow and asked, "Where are you from, monk, and
what are you doing in this desolate spot?"
"We are holy monks going to fetch the scriptures," Monkey replied. "Yesterday we lost our master here, and
we would like to ask you, sir, where the Bodhisattva Lingji lives."
"Lingji lives a thousand miles due South of here," the old man said, "on a mountain called Little Mount
Sumeru. There is a holy place there which is the monastery where he preaches the scriptures. Are you going to
fetch scriptures from him."
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 311
"No," Monkey replied, "we're going not to fetch scriptures from him, but to trouble him over something else.
How does one get there?"
The old man pointed South and said, "That twisting path will take you." Thus tricking the Great Sage into
turning round to look, the old man turned into a puff of wind and disappeared from sight. All that could be
seen of him was a piece of paper he had left beside the road. On it there were four lines of verse that read:
"I report to the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,
That I am Long Life Li.
On Sumeru Mountain there is a Flying Dragon Staff,
The weapon the Buddha once gave to Lingji."
Brother Monkey took the note turned, and set off. "What lousy luck we've been having for the last few days,
brother," said Pig. "For the last couple of days we've been seeing ghosts even in broad daylight. Who was that
old man who turned into a wind?" Monkey handed the piece of paper to him, and when he had read it he said,
"Who is this Long Life Li?"
"He's the Great White Planet of the West," Monkey replied.
Pig immediately bowed low and said, "My benefactor, my benefactor. If he hadn't put in a memorial to the
Jade Emperor, I don't know what would have become of me."
"So you're capable of feeling gratitude," said Monkey. "Meanwhile, you're to hide deep in these woods
without showing yourself, and keep a close watch on the baggage and the horse while I go to Mount Sumeru
to ask the Bodhisattva to come."
"Understood," said Pig, "understood. You go as fast as you can. I've learned the tortoise's trick, and can pull
my head in when necessary."
The Great Sage Monkey leapt into the air and headed South on his somersault cloud at tremendous speed. He
could cover a thousand miles with a nod of his head, and do eight hundred stages with a twist of his waist. It
was only an instant before he saw a high mountain surrounded by auspicious clouds and a propitious aura. In a
valley on the mountain there was a monastery from which the distant sounds of bells and stone chimes could
be heard, and a haze of incense smoke hung above it. Monkey went straight to the gate, where he saw a lay
brother with prayer beads round his neck who was invoking the Buddha.
"Greetings, lay brother," said Monkey, clasping his hands in salutation.
The lay brother bowed to him in reply and said, "Where are you from, sir?"
"Is this where the Bodhisattva Lingji preaches the scriptures?" Monkey asked.
"Yes, this is the place," the lay brother replied. "Have you a message for him?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 312
"I would like you to tell him that I am Brother Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, a disciple of
the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Tang in the East, and
there is a matter about which I should like to see the Bodhisattva."
"That's far too many words for me to remember, sir," said the lay brother with a smile.
"Then tell him that the Tang Priest's disciple Sun Wukong is here," Monkey replied. The lay brother did as he
asked and went into the preaching hall to pass on the message. The Bodhisattva put on his cassock, burnt
some incense, and prepared to receive him. As the Great Sage went through the gate and looked inside he
saw:
A hall full of brocade,
A room of awe−inspiring majesty.
All the monks were chanting the Lotus Sutra
While the aged head priest lightly struck the golden chime.
The offerings made to the Buddha
Were magic fruit and magic flowers;
Set out on tables
Were meatless delicacies.
Dazzling candles
Sent golden flames up to the rainbow,
From fragrant incense
Jade smoke rose to the translucent mist.
With the sermon over and the mind at peace, a trance was entered.
White clouds coiled around the tops of the pine trees.
When the sword of wisdom is sheathed, the demon is beheaded;
Great are the powers of the prajna−paramita.
The Bodhisattva straightened his clothes and came out to meet Monkey, who climbed the steps into the hall
and sat in the guest's seat. When the orders were given for tea to be brought, Monkey said, "I won't trouble
you to give me tea. My master is in trouble on the Yellow Wind Mountain, and I have come to ask you,
Bodhisattva, to use your great powers to subdue the demon and rescue my master."
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 313
"I have been ordered by the Tathagata Buddha to guard over the Yellow Wind Monster," the Bodhisattva
replied. "The Tathagata gave me a Wind−settling Pill and a Flying Dragon Staff. When I captured that
monster before, the Tathagata spared his life and exiled him to live in seclusion on this mountain, where he is
not allowed to kill or do any other evil. I never imagined that he would want to murder your master today. I
must hold myself responsible for this as I have failed to carry out my orders." The Bodhisattva wanted to keep
Monkey for a meal and a talk, but in response to Monkey's urgent pleading he took his Flying Dragon Staff
and rode off with the Great Sage by cloud.
A moment later they reached the Yellow Wind Mountain, and the Bodhisattva said, "Great Sage, as this evil
monster is a bit scared of me, I'd better stay here inside the cloud while you go down and challenge him to
come out and fight. Once you've lured him out, I can use my divine power." Doing as he suggested, Monkey
brought his cloud down to land; and without more ado he smashed down the gates of the cave with his iron
cudgel.
"Fiendish monster," he shouted, "give my master back."
The junior fiends on the gate all rushed back to report this, and the old monster said, "That damned ape really
has a cheek−−instead of behaving himself properly, he comes to smash my gates down. This time I'll use a
magic wind that will certainly blow him to death." Putting on his armour and taking his trident as before, he
went out through the gate, and the moment he saw Monkey, he thrust straight at his chest with his trident, not
uttering a single word. Monkey sidestepped to dodge it and hit back at the monster's face with his cudgel.
When only a few rounds had been fought, the monster turned to the Southeast and was just going to open his
mouth and blow out a wind when the Bodhisattva Lingji appeared in mid−air and dropped the Flying Dragon
Staff on him. While the monster recited all sorts of spells, an eight−clawed golden dragon grabbed him with
two of its claws and smashed him several times against a rock−face. At this the monster reverted to his real
form−−a brown marten.
Monkey rushed at it and had raised his cudgel to kill it when the Bodhisattva stopped him and said, "Don't kill
it, Great Sage. I must take it back to see the Tathagata. He used to be a marten who had obtained the Way
underneath the Vulture Peak, and once he stole some of the pure oil from a crystal lamp. When the lamp went
out he was so afraid of being caught by a Vajrapani that he ran away and became a spirit monster here. The
Tathagata decided that as this was not a capital offence I should be sent to keep guard over him; but if he took
life or committed any other evil deeds he was to be taken to the Vulture Peak. As he has now offended you,
Great Sage, and captured the Tang Priest with the intention of murdering him, I must take him to see the
Tathagata to be sentenced for his crime before this business can be regarded as cleared up."
Pig, meanwhile, who had been wondering about Monkey as he waited in the wood, heard a shout from the
mountainside, "Pig, bring the luggage and the horse out."
Recognizing the voice as Monkey's, the idiot rushed out of the wood with the things and asked Monkey,
"How did it go?"
"I asked the Bodhisattva Lingji to come, and he used his Flying Dragon Staff to capture the evil spirit, who
turned out to have been the spirit of a brown−coated marten and was taken off to the Vulture Peak by the
Bodhisattva to see the Buddha. We two had better go into the cave to rescue our master." The idiot was very
pleased to hear the news.
The pair of them charged into the cave and killed all the evil hares, fox−fiends, roebuck, and deer inside with
the iron club and the rake. Then they went into the garden at the back to rescue their master. When he was
outside he asked, "How did you two capture that evil spirit? How did you manage to rescue me?" Monkey
told him all about how Lingji had subdued the fined, and Sanzang expressed his gratitude at great length while
Journey to the West
Chapter 21 314
the two prepared a meal from the meatless food that there was in the cave. Then they left the cave and looked
for the main path West once more.
If you don't know what happened later, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 22
Pig Fights a Great Battle in the Flowing Sands River
Moksa Obeys the Dharma and Wins Friar Sand Over
The story tells how the Tang Priest and his two disciples escaped from their troubles and pressed forward.
Before long they had crossed the Yellow Wind Ridge and were heading West across a plain. The time passed
rapidly, and summer gave way to autumn. Cold cicadas sang in moulting willow trees, and the Great Fire Star
sank below the Western horizon. As they were travelling one day they saw the mighty waves of a great river,
boiling and raging. "Disciple," called out Sanzang from his horse, "do you see that broad river in front of us?
Why are there no boats on it, and how are we going to get across?"
"Those are really terrible waves," said Pig when he saw the river, "and there aren't any boats to ferry us over."
Monkey sprang into the sky, shaded his eyes with his hand, and looked. "Master," he said with horror, "we're
in big trouble here. I can cross a river like this with a twist of my waist, but I'm afraid you'll never be able to
cross it in ten thousand years."
"How wide is it, then?" Sanzang asked. "I can't see the other bank from here."
"About three hundred miles," Monkey replied. "How can you be so sure of the distance, brother?" Pig asked.
"These eyes of mine can see what's happening three hundred and fifty miles away in daytime," Monkey
replied. "When I took a look from up in the air just now I couldn't make out the length of the river, but I could
see that it was a good three hundred and fifty miles wide." Depressed and worried, Sanzang reined in his horse
and noticed a stone tablet beside the river. The three of them went to look at it, and they saw the words
FLOWING SANDS RIVER inscribed on it in the ancient curly style. On the base of the tablet were four lines
in the standard script:
"Three hundred miles of flowing sands,
Three thousand fathoms of weak water,
On which a goose feather will not float,
And the flower of a reed will sink."
As the three of them were looking at this tablet they heard the waves make a roar like a collapsing mountain
as a most hideous evil spirit emerged from the water:
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 315
A head of matted hair, as red as fire,
A pair of staring eyes, gleaming like lamps.
An indigo face, neither black nor green,
A dragon's voice like drums or thunder.
On his body a cloak of yellow goose−down,
Tied at the waist with white creeper.
Nine skulls hung around his neck,
And in his hands was an enormous staff.
The monster came to the bank in a whirlwind and rushed straight at the Tang Priest. Monkey picked Sanzang
up at once, turned, and made off up the high bank. Pig dropped his carrying−pole, grabbed his rake, and
struck at the evil spirit, who parried the blow with his staff. Each of them showed his prowess on the banks of
the Flowing Sands River, and it was a fine battle:
The nine−pronged rake,
And the ogre−quelling staff:
Two men fighting on the banks of the river.
One was the great commander Tian Peng
The other the banished Curtain−lifting General.
They used to meet in the Hall of Miraculous Mist,
But now they were locked in ferocious combat.
The rake had dug deep into clawed dragons,
The staff had defeated tusked elephants.
When either was held defensively, it was rock−solid;
In attack they cut into the wind.
While one clawed at head and face,
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 316
The other never panicked or left an opening.
One was the man−eating monster of the Flowing Sands River,
The other was a believer, a general cultivating his conduct.
The pair of them battled on for twenty rounds, but neither emerged as the victor. The Great Sage, who was
holding on to the horse and looking after the luggage after carrying the Tang Priest to safety, became worked
up into such a fury at the sight of Pig and the monster fighting that he ground his teeth and clenched his fists.
When he could hold himself back no longer, he pulled out his cudgel and said, "Master, you sit here and don't
be afraid. I'm going to play with him." Ignoring Sanzang's pleas for him to stay, he whistled, jumped down to
the side of the river, and found that the fight between Pig and the ogre was at its height. Brother Monkey
swung his cudgel and aimed it at the ogre's head, but the ogre made a lightning turn and plunged straight into
the river. Pig was hopping mad.
"Nobody asked you to come, elder brother," he said. "That ogre was tiring and he could hardly fend my rake
off. With few more rounds I would have captured him, but you gave him such a fright that he ran away, damn
it."
"Brother," said Monkey with a smile, "I must tell you frankly that the sight of you fighting so beautifully gave
me an uncontrollable itch. I haven't used my cudgel for a whole month since we came down the mountain
after dealing with the Yellow Wind Monster−−I just had to join in the fun. How was I to know that the
monster wouldn't want to play and was going to run away?"
The two of them then clasped hands and went back talking and laughing to see Sanzang, who asked, "Did you
catch the ogre?"
"No," Monkey said, "he couldn't take any more and dived back into the water."
"He has lived here for a long time, disciple," Sanzang said, "and must know the shallows and deeps here. We
must have a water expert to lead us across this vast expanse of weak water that has no boats."
"Yes," said Monkey, "as the saying goes, 'What's near cinnabar goes red, and what's next to ink turns black.'
As that ogre lives here he must be a water expert, so if we catch him we shouldn't kill him−−we should make
him take you across, master, before finishing him off."
"There's no time to lose, brother," said Pig. "You go and catch him while I look after the master."
"This is something I can't talk big about," said Monkey with a smile. "I'm not all that good at underwater stuff.
Even to walk underwater I have to make a magic hand movement and recite a water−repelling spell before I
can move. The only other way I can get about there is by turning myself into a fish, a shrimp, a crab or a
turtle. I can manage any strange and wonderful magic on a mountain or in the clouds that you can do, but
when it comes to underwater business, I'm useless."
"When I was the commander of the Milky Way, the heavenly river, in the old days," said Pig, "I had a force of
eighty thousand sailors, so I know a bit about water. But I'm afraid that he might have generations of
clansmen down there, and that would be too much for me. And if they got me, we'd be in a real mess."
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 317
"You go into the water and start a fight with him there," said Monkey. "Don't fight hard, and don't win. You
must lose and lure him out, then I can finish him off for you."
"Very well then, I'll be off," said Pig. After stripping off his brocade tunic and removing his shoes he swung
his rake in both hands and made his way into the water, where the tricks he had learned years back enabled
him to go through the waves to the river−bed, across which he advanced.
The ogre had now recovered his breath after his earlier defeat, and when he heard someone pushing the waters
aside he leapt to his feet to look. Seeing that it was Pig brandishing his rake, the monster raised his staff and
shouted at him, "Where do you think you're going, monk? Watch out, and take this."
Pig warded off the blow with his rake and replied. "Who are you, evil spirit, and why are you blocking the
way?"
"You may not realize who I am," the monster replied, "but I'm no fiend, demon, ghost or monster, and I don't
lack a name either."
"If you're not a fiend, a demon, or a monster, then why do you live here taking life? Tell me your name
truthfully and I'll spare you life."
"I," the monster replied,
"Have had a divine essence since childhood,
And have wandered all over heaven and earth.
I have won glory among the heroes of the world,
And brave knights have taken me as their model.
I traveled at will over countries and continents,
Going where I liked in lakes and seas,
To study the Way I went to the edge of the heavens,
And I roamed the wastes in search of teachers.
In those days I had a cassock and an alms−bowl,
And I kept my mind and spirit well controlled.
I traveled the earth by cloud some dozen times,
Visiting everywhere on a hundred journeys.
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 318
The Immortal I finally managed to find
Led me along the great and shining Way.
First I gathered mercury and lead,
Then I let go of the Mother of Wood and Metal's Father.
The kidney−water behind my brow entered my mouth,
And the liver−fire in my windpipes entered my heart.
With three thousand accomplishment won,
I bowed to the heavenly countenance;
Piously I worshipped him in his glory.
The Great Jade Emperor then promoted me
To be the General Who Lifts the Curtain.
I was honoured within the Southern Gate of Heaven,
Supreme before the Hall of Miraculous Mist.
At my waist was hung the tiger tally,
In my hand I held my demon−quelling staff.
My golden helmet shone like sunlight,
On my body gleamed a suit of armour.
I led the escort for the Emperor's carriage,
Always took precedence when he entered or left court.
But then the Queen Mother gathered the peaches
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 319
And invited all the generals to feast at the Jade Pool.
I carelessly smashed some jade and crystal,
To the horror of all of the heavenly gods.
The Jade Emperor in his terrible fury
Put his hands together and fumed to the vice−premier.
My hat and armour were removed, and I was stripped of office,
Then marched to the place of execution.
Then, to my good fortune, the great Bare−foot Immortal
Stepped forward to ask for my reprieve.
Death was commuted; I was allowed to live
In exile on the East bank of the Flowing Sands River.
When well−fed I sleep in the river waters;
When hungry I burst through the waves in search of food.
If a woodcutter meets me his life is finished−−
No fisherman sees me and survives.
In one way and another I've eaten many a man,
Cloaked as I am in an aura of death.
As you've dared to come to make trouble at my gates
My belly has something to look forward to today.
No matter if you're coarse and don't taste good,
When I've caught you I can cut you up for salted mince."
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 320
Pig was extremely angry to hear this, and he replied, "You're completely blind, wretch. I can catch bubbles in
my fingers, so how dare you say that I'm so coarse you'll cut me up for salted mince? So you take me to be a
very well−cured side of ham! Don't be impudent−−take a dose of this rake." When the monster saw the rake
coming at him he did a "phoenix nod" to avoid it. The two of them fought their way up to the surface of the
water, where each of them trod on the waves as they struggled in a combat that was even fiercer than their
previous one.
The Curtain−lifting General,
And Marshal Tian Peng;
Each gave a splendid show of magic powers.
The ogre−quelling staff wheels around the head,
The nine−pronged rake is swift in the hand.
As they leap on the waves, they shake hills and rivers,
Darkening the world as they push the waters aside,
As terrible as the Disaster Star striking banners and pendants,
As frightening as lifting the canopy off the Death Star.
One was the loyal defender of the Tang Priest,
The other, a criminal, was an ogre of the waters.
Where the rake struck it left nine scars;
When the staff smote, all the souls were scattered.
Cheerfully fighting for all they were worth,
They put all their hearts into the combat.
Although he is only a pilgrim fetching scriptures
His unrestrained anger bursts against the sky.
Such was the chaos that the fishes lost their scales,
While the soft shells of terrapins were crushed;
Red prawns and purple crabs all lost their lives,
And all the gods of the water palace prayed to heaven.
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 321
The only sound was the thunder of crashing waves;
Sun and moon were dark, to the horror of earth and sky.
They battled on for four hours, but the issue was still undecided. It was as if a brass pan was fighting an iron
brush, or a jade chime was competing with a golden bell.
The Great Sage, who was standing beside the Tang Priest to guard him, watched the fight on the water with
longing, unable to do anything. Then Pig feinted with his rake, pretended to be beaten, and made for the
Eastern bank with the ogre rushing after him. When he had almost reached the bank, Monkey could hold
himself back no longer. Abandoning his master, he sprang down to the river's edge with his cudgel in his hand
and took a swing at the ogre's head. Not daring to face him, the monster went straight back into the river.
"Protector of the Horses," Pig shouted, "you impatient ape. You should have taken it a bit more slowly and
waited till I'd drawn him up to high ground, and then cut him off from the river−bank. Then he wouldn't have
been able to go back and we'd have caught him. But now he's gone back in, he'll never come out again."
"Don't shout, idiot," Monkey said with a smile, "don't shout. Let's go back and see our master."
When Pig reached the top of the bank with Monkey, Sanzang bowed to him and said, "You've had a tough
time, disciple."
"I wouldn't say that," Pig replied. "But if we'd captured that evil spirit and made him take you across the river,
that would have been the perfect solution."
"How did your battle with the evil spirit go?" Sanzang asked.
"He's as good as me," Pig replied. "When I pretended to be beaten in the fight he chased me to the river's
edge; but then he saw elder brother waving his cudgel, so he ran away."
"So what are we going to do?" Sanzang asked.
"Relax, master," said Monkey, "there's no need to worry. It's getting late, so you'd better sit on the bank while
I go and beg some food. When you've eaten that you can go to sleep, and we can decide what to do tomorrow
morning."
"Good idea," said Pig. "Be as quick as you can."
Monkey leapt up on his cloud, went due North to a house where he begged some food, and came back to give
it to his master. Seeing him come back so soon, Sanzang said to him, "Monkey, let's go to the house where
you begged this food and ask them how to cross this river. That would be better than having to fight this
ogre."
"But that house is a long way away," laughed Monkey. "It's about two thousand miles from here. What would
be the point in asking them about this river? They wouldn't know anything about it."
"You're telling tall stories again," Pig said. "If it's two thousand miles away, how did you get there and back
so fast?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 22 322
"You wouldn't know, of course," Brother Monkey replied, "that my somersault cloud can cover thirty−six
thousand miles with a single bound. To do a mere two−thousand−mile return journey takes only a couple of
nods and a bow−−there's nothing to it."
"If it's so easy, brother," said Pig, "you should carry the master on your back, take him across with just a
couple of nods and a bow, and save us all the trouble of fighting the monster."
"You can ride clouds, can't you?" said Monkey. "Why don't you carry the master across?"
"The master's mortal flesh and bones are heavier than Mount Tai," said Pig, "So although I can ride clouds I
could never lift him. Nothing but your somersault will do the trick."
"My somersault is the same as cloud−riding." Monkey said, "except that it takes you further. I'm no more able
to carry him than you are. As the old saying goes, 'Mount Tai is as easy to move as a mustard seed, but a
mortal cannot be dragged away from the earthly dust.' When that other poisonous monster of a fiend made a
magic wind I could only move the master by dragging and tugging him along the ground. Of course. I can do
tricks like that, and all those other ones like making myself invisible or shrinking land. But although our
master cannot escape from the sea of suffering he wants to go to a foreign land, so he finds every inch of the
way heavy going. All we can do is escort him and see that he comes to no harm. We can't undergo all that
suffering on his behalf, nor can we fetch the scriptures for him. Even if we went ahead to see the Buddha, he
wouldn't give the scriptures to you or me. After all, if we could get them that easily, we'd have nothing to do."
The idiot accepted everything Monkey said, then they ate some plain rice without any vegetables, after which
the three of them went to sleep on the Eastern bank of the Flowing Sands River.
"Monkey," said Sanzang the next morning, "what are we going to do about me to battle
because he can't bring himself to escort us across. I tell you, brother, those three evil spirits are brothers and
they have a sense of honour. We're three brothers but we don't. I've beaten the senior demon, so the second
demon's come out. There's no reason why you shouldn't fight him."
"I'm not scared of him," Pig said. "I'll go and give him a fight."
"If you want to, go ahead," Monkey replied.
"Brother," said Pig with a laugh, "I'll go, but lend me that rope."
"What do you want it for?" Monkey asked. "You don't know how to get into his belly or tie it to his heart, so
what use would it be to you?"
"I want it tied round my waist as a lifeline," replied Pig. "You and Friar Sand are to hold on to it and let it out
for me to fight him. If you think I'm beating him pay more rope out and I'll capture him, but if he's beating me,
pull me back. Don't let him drag me off."
At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought, "Another chance to make a fool of the idiot." Monkey then
tied the rope round Pig's waist and sent him off into battle.
The idiot lifted his rake and rushed up the steep slope shouting. "Come out, evil spirit! Come and fight your
ancestor Pig!" The herald with the blue flag rushed back to report, "Your Majesty, there's a monk with a long
snout and big ears here." The second demon chief came out of the encampment, saw Pig, and without a word
thrust his spear straight at Pig's face. The idiot raised his rake and went forward to parry the blow. The two of
them joined battle in front of the mountainside, and before they had fought seven or eight rounds the idiot
began to weaken. He was no longer able to hold the evil spirit off.
"Brother," he shouted, turning back in a hurry, "pull in the lifeline, pull in the lifeline!" When the Great Sage
heard this from where he stood he loosened his hold on the rope and dropped it. The idiot started to run back
now that he was defeated. At first he had not noticed the rope trailing behind him, but after he turned back,
relaxing the tension on it, it started to get tangled round his legs. He tripped himself over, climbed to his feet
and tripped over again. At first he only staggered, but then he fell facedown into the dust. The evil spirit
caught up with him, unwound his trunk that was like a python, wrapped it round Pig and carried him back in
triumph to the cave. The devilish host chorused a paean of victory as they swarmed back.
When Sanzang saw all this from the foot of the slope he became angry with Monkey. "Wukong," he said, "no
wonder Wuneng wishes you were dead. You brother−disciples don't love each other at all. All you feel is
jealousy. He told you to pull in his lifeline, so why didn't you? Why did you drop the rope instead? What are
we to do now you have got him killed?"
"You're covering up for him again, Master," said Monkey, "and showing favoritism too. I'm fed up. When I
was captured it didn't bother you at all. I was dispensable. But when that idiot gets himself caught you blame
me for it. Let him suffer. It'll teach him how hard it is to fetch the scriptures."

Chapter 76 1063
"Disciple," said Sanzang, "was I not worried when you went? I remembered that you could change into other
things, so I was sure you would come to no harm. But the idiot was born clumsy and can't transform himself,
which makes this a very dangerous business. You must go and rescue him."
"Stop complaining, Master," said Brother Monkey. "I'll go and save him."
Monkey rushed up the mountain thinking resentfully, "I'm not going to make life easy for that idiot if he
wishes me dead. I'll go and see what the evil spirits are doing with him. Before I rescue him I'll let him suffer
a bit." He then made magic with his hands, said the words of a spell, shook himself, turned into the tiniest of
insects and flew into the cave, where he landed at the bottom of one of Pig's ears to be taken inside with the
evil spirit. The second demon chief had led his three thousand junior devils trumpeting and drumming loudly
to the cave, where they stopped.
He now took Pig inside and said, "I've got one, elder brother."
"Show me," the senior demon replied.
Unwinding his trunk the second demon chief flung Pig to the ground and said, "There he is."
"That one's useless," said the senior demon.
"Your Majesty," put in Pig when he heard this, "if I'm no use let me go and find a more useful one to capture."
"He may not be any use," said the third demon chief, "but he is the Tang Priest's disciple Zhu Bajie. Tie him
up and put him to soak in the pool at the back. When his bristles have been soaked off we can open his belly
up, salt him and dry him in the sun. He'll go down well with some wine on a rainy day."
"That's that then," exclaimed Pig in horror. "I've fallen into the clutches of a demon who's a salt−pork
peddler." The demon hordes fell on him, tied his hands and feet together, carried him to the pool at the back,
pushed him in and went back.
When the Great Sage flew there to have a look he saw the idiot with his four limbs pointing upwards and his
snout downwards as he half floated and was half sinking, grunting through his snout. He really was a
ridiculous sight, like a big blackened frost−bitten lotus pod that has shed its seeds in September or October.
Seeing his face the Great Sage felt both loathing and pity for him.
"What shall I do?" he wondered. "After all, he is another member of the Dragon Flower Assembly. I just wish
he wouldn't keep trying to divide up the luggage, split our band, and incite the master to say the
Band−tightening Spell. The other day I heard Friar Sand say that he'd stashed some money away for himself. I
wonder if it's true. I'll give him a scare and find out."
The splendid Great Sage flew down to his ear and called in a disguised voice, "Zhu Wuneng, Zhu Wuneng."
"This is terrible," thought Pig in alarm, "Wuneng is the name the Bodhisattva Guanyin gave me. I've been
called Zhu Bajie all the time I've been with the Tang Priest. How can there be anyone here who knows my
name is Wuneng?" So he could not restrain himself from asking, "Who's that calling my Buddhist name?"
"Me," said Monkey.
"Who are you?" the idiot asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 76 1064
"I'm a catcher," Monkey replied.
"Where from, sir?" asked Pig in terror.
"From the Fifth King of the Underworld, and he's sent me to fetch you," said Monkey.
"Then please go back and ask the Fifth King as he's such a good friend of my senior fellow−disciple Sun
Wukong to give me a day's grace. You can come for me tomorrow."
"You're talking nonsense," Monkey replied. "If King Yama of Hell decides you're to die in the third watch
nobody will keep you till the fourth. Come with me at once if you don't want me to put a rope round your
neck and drag you off."
"Do me a favour," said the idiot. "Even with a face like mine still want to go on living. I'll certainly die if I
have to, but give me a day till these evil spirits have captured my master and the rest of us, so I can see them
again before we're all done for."
"Very well then," said Monkey, grinning to himself. "I've got about thirty people to capture around here in this
batch. When I've caught them I'll come back for you. That'll give you a day's grace. Give me some money. I'm
sure you've got some."
"Oh dear," said Pig, "we monks don't have money."
"If you haven't then I'm dragging you off," said Brother Monkey. "Come with me."
"Don't be so impatient, sir," said the idiot, panicking. "I know that rope of yours is what they call the
life−taking rope. Once It's round you you're dead. Yes, I have got some money. I've got a bit, but not much."
"Where is it?" Monkey demanded. "Give it me at once."
"Oh dear, what a pity!" said Pig. "From when I became a monk right up till now the kind people who feed
monks have given me a bit more alms than the others because my belly's so big. I saved all the little bits of
silver till I had about half an ounce. They were awkward to keep, so when we were in a city some time ago I
asked a silversmith to melt them all together. The wicked man stole a few grains of it, so the ingot he made
only weighed forty−six hundredths of an ounce. Take it."
"The idiot hasn't even got his trousers on," grinned Monkey to himself, "so where can he have hidden it? Hey,
where's your silver?"
"It's stuffed inside my left ear," Pig replied. "I can't get it myself because I'm tied up, so take it out yourself."
When Monkey heard this he put his hand out and took the silver from inside Pig's ear. It was indeed an ingot
shaped like a saddle that weighed only forty−five or forty−six hundredths of an ounce. As he held it in his
hands Monkey could not help roaring with laughter.
Recognizing Monkey's voice the idiot started cursing him wildly from the water: "Damn and blast you,
Protector of the Horses, for coming to extort money from me when I'm in such misery."
"I've got you now, you dreg−guzzler!" said Monkey. "Goodness only knows what I've had to suffer for the
sake of protecting the master, while you've been making your fortune."
Journey to the West
Chapter 76 1065
"Nonsense!" Pig retorted. "Call this a fortune? It's just what I've scraped off my teeth. I resisted spending it on
my stomach, so I saved it to buy myself some cloth to get a tunic made. You've got it out of me by
intimidation. You ought to share it with me."
"You won't get a cent of it," Monkey replied.
"I've paid you to spare my life," said Pig, "so now you damn well ought to rescue me."
"Don't be so impatient," said Monkey. "I'll rescue you all in good time." Putting the silver away he turned
back into himself and used his cudgel to bring Pig close enough to grab him by his feet, drag him ashore and
untie him. Pig then sprang up, took off his clothes, wrung them out, shook them, and draped them still
dripping wet over his shoulders.
"Brother," he said, "open the back gates. Let's go."
"There's no glory in sneaking out the back way," replied Monkey. "We'll leave by the front gates."
"My feet are still numb after being tied up," said Pig. "I can't run."
"Buck up and come with me," said Monkey.
The splendid Great Sage charged out, clearing his way by swinging his cudgel. The idiot had no choice but to
endure the pain and keep close to him. When he saw the rake propped up by the second pair of gates he went
over to it, pushed the junior devils aside, retrieved it and rushed forward, lashing out wildly. He and Brother
Monkey charged through three or four pairs of gates, and goodness only knows how many junior devils they
killed.
When the senior demon chief heard all this he said to the second chief, "You captured a fine one! A fine one
indeed! Look! Sun the Novice has rescued Pig and they've wounded or killed the juniors on the gates." The
second demon at once sprang to his feet and rushed out through the gates brandishing his spear.
"Damned macaque," he shouted at the top of his voice. "What a nerve! How dare you treat us with such
contempt!" As soon as the Great Sage heard this he stopped still. The monster thrust his spear straight at him
without allowing any argument. With the unhurried skill of the expert Monkey raised his iron cudgel to hit
back at the demon's face. The two of them fought a splendid battle outside the entrance to the cave:
The yellow−tusked elephant in human form
Had sworn brotherhood with the Lion King.
Persuaded by the senior monster
They plotted together to eat the Tang Priest.
Huge were the powers of the Great Sage, Heaven's equal,
Who helped the good against the bad and killed off demons,
The incompetent Pig had met with disaster,
Journey to the West
Chapter 76 1066
So Monkey saved him and led him outside.
When the demon king pursued them with great ferocity
The spear and the cudgel each showed off its powers.
The spear moved like a snake in the woods;
The cudgel arose like a dragon from the sea.
Where the dragon emerged the clouds were thick;
Dense hung the mist where the snake went through the woods.
It was all for the sake of the Tang Priest
That they fought each other with ferocity and hatred.
When he saw the Great Sage start fighting the evil spirit, Pig stood on the spur, his rake upright. Instead of
joining in to help, he watched with stupefied amazement. Monkey's cudgel was so powerful and his martial
skills so faultless the evil spirit used his spear to parry Monkey's blows while unrolling his trunk to wrap
round him. As Monkey knew about this trick he held his gold−banded cudgel out horizontally in both hands
and raised them. The evil spirit's trunk caught Monkey round the waist but missed his hands. Just watch how
Monkey belabors the evil spirit's trunk with his cudgel.
When Pig saw this he beat his chest and said, "Oh dear! That monster's got lousy luck. When he caught me he
got my arms too because I'm so clumsy, but he didn't when he caught that slippery character. He's got his
cudgel in both hands, and all he needs to do is shove it up the monster's trunk to give him such a pain in the
nostrils that it'll make the snot run. The monster'll never be able to hold him."
Monkey had not thought of this before Pig gave him the idea, but now he waved his cudgel to make it as thick
as a hen's egg and over ten feet long and actually did shove it hard up the monster's trunk. This gave the evil
spirit such a shock that he unraveled his trunk with a swishing noise. Monkey brought his hand round to grab
the trunk and drag it forcefully towards him. To spare himself any more agony the monster stepped out and
moved with Monkey's hand. Only then did Pig dare approach, raising his rake to hit wildly at the monster's
flanks.
"No," said Brother Monkey, "that's no good. The prongs of your rake are so sharp they might break his skin. If
he starts bleeding heavily and the master sees it he'll say we've been killing again. You'd better turn it round
and hit him with the handle."
The idiot then raised the handle of his rake and struck the monster at every step while Monkey dragged him
by the trunk. They looked like a pair of elephant boys as they led him down to the foot of the mountain, where
Sanzang could be seen gazing with concentration at the two of them coming noisily towards him.
"Wujing," he said to Friar Sand, "what is it Wukong is leading?"
"Master," replied Friar Sand when he saw them, "big brother is dragging an evil spirit here by the nose. He
really enjoys slaughter."
Journey to the West
Chapter 76 1067
"Splendid, splendid," said Sanzang. "What a big evil spirit, and what a long nose! Go and ask him if he's
happy and willing to escort us over the−mountain. If he is he must be spared and not be killed."
Friar Sand at once rushed straight towards them shouting, "The master says you mustn't kill the monster if he's
really willing to escort him across the mountain." As soon as he heard this the demon fell to his knees and
promised to do so in a very nasal voice. His voice was like this because Monkey was pinching his nostrils
shut, making it sound as though he had a heavy cold.
"Lord Tang," he said, "I'll carry you across by chair if you spare my life."
"My master and we disciples are good people." Monkey replied. "As you've said this we'll spare your life.
Fetch the chair at once. If you break your word again we most certainly won't spare your life when we catch
you next time." The freed monster kowtowed and left. Monkey and Pig went to report to the Tang Priest on
everything that had happened to them. Pig was overcome with shame as he spread his clothes out to dry in the
sun while they waited.
The second demon chief returned trembling and shaking to the cave. Even before his return some junior devils
had reported to the senior and the third demon chiefs that Monkey had dragged him off by the trunk. In his
anxiety the senior demon had led his hosts out with the third demon when they saw the second chief coming
back alone. As they brought him inside and asked him why he had been released the second chief told them
all about Sanzang's words of mercy and goodness. They looked at each other, at a loss for words.
"Elder brother," said the second demon chief, "shall we take Sanzang across?"
"What a thing to say, brother," replied the senior chief. "Sun the Novice is a monkey who shows the greatest
benevolence and sense of justice. If he had wanted to kill me when he was in my stomach he could most
certainly have done so. He only grabbed your trunk. He might have dragged you off and not let you go. All he
did was to pinch your trunk and break its skin, and that's given you a scare. Get ready at once to take them
across."
The third demon chief smiled and said, "Yes, yes, yes!"
"From the way you're talking, my good brother," said the senior demon, "it sounds as though you're reluctant
to let the Tang Priest go. If you don't, we'll take him across."
The third demon chief smiled again and said, "Elder brothers, it would have been luckier for those monks if
they hadn't asked us to escort them but had slipped quietly across instead. By asking us to escort them they've
fallen in with our plan to lure the tiger down from the mountain."
"What do you mean by 'luring the tiger from the mountain?'" the senior demon asked.
"Summon all the demons in our cave," the third demon chief continued. "Choose one thousand from the ten
thousand of them, then a hundred from the thousand, then sixteen and thirty from the hundred."
"Why do you want sixteen and thirty?" the senior demon asked.
"The thirty must be good cooks," the third demon chief replied. "Give them the best rice and flour, bamboo
shoots, tea, gill fungus, button mushrooms, beancurd and wheat gluten. Send them to put up a shelter seven to
ten miles along the way and lay on a meal for the Tang Priest."
Journey to the West
Chapter 76 1068
"And what do you want the sixteen for?" the senior demon asked.
"Eight to carry the chair and eight to shout and clear the way," the third demon replied. "We brothers will
accompany them for a stage of their journey. About 150 miles West of here is my city, and I've plenty of
troops there to greet them. When they get to the city we'll do such and such and so on... The Tang Priest and
his disciples won't be able to see what's happening to them. Whether we catch the Tang Priest or not depends
completely on those sixteen demons."
The senior demon was beside himself with delight on hearing this. It was as if he had recovered from a
drunken stupor or woken up from a dream. "Excellent, excellent," he said, whereupon he mustered the
demons, chose thirty to whom he gave the food and another sixteen to carry a rattan chair. As they set out the
senior demon gave the following instructions to the rest of the demons: "None of you are to go out on the
mountain. Sun the Novice is a very cautious ape, and if he sees any of you around he'll be suspicious and see
through our plan."
The senior demon then led his underlings to a place beside the main road, where he called aloud, "Lord Tang,
today's not an unlucky one, so please come across the mountain straight away."
"Who is that calling me, Wukong?" Sanzang asked when he heard this.
"It's the demons I beat," Monkey replied. "They're bringing a chair to carry you."
Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang looked up to the sky and said, "Splendid, splendid!
But for my worthy disciple's great abilities I could not proceed on my journey." He then walked forward to
greet the demons with the words, "I am most grateful for the consideration you gentlemen are showing. When
my disciples and I return to Chang'an we will praise your admirable achievements."
"Please get into the carrying−chair, my lord," the demons said, kowtowing. Having mortal eyes and body
Sanzang did not realize that this was a trick. The Great Sage Sun, a golden immortal of the Supreme Monad
with a loyal nature, thought that because he had captured and released the demons they were now won over.
He never imagined that they had other plots in mind, so he did not investigate closely but went along with his
master's ideas. He told Pig to tie the luggage on the horse and keep close to the master with Friar Sand while
he cleared the way with his iron cudgel, watching out to see if all was well. While eight devils carried the
chair and eight shouted in turn to clear the way the three demon chiefs steadied the poles of the chair. The
master was delighted to sit upright in it and go up the high mountain by the main track, little realizing that
Great grief would return in the midst of rejoicing;
"Extremes," says the classic, "create their negation."
Fated they were to meet with disaster,
A star of ill−omen to mark desolation.
The band of demons worked with one mind to escort them and serve them diligently at all times. After ten
miles there was a vegetarian meal and after fifteen more miles another one. They were invited to rest before it
grew late, and everything along their way was neat and tidy. Each day they had three most satisfactory and
Journey to the West
Chapter 76 1069
delightful meals and spent a comfortable night where they were able to sleep well.
When they had traveled about 150 miles West they found themselves near a walled city. Raising his iron
cudgel the Great Sage, who was only a third of a mile ahead of the carrying−chair, was so alarmed by the
sight of the city that he fell over and was unable to rise to his feet. Do you know why someone of his great
courage was so frightened by what he saw? It was because he saw a very evil atmosphere hanging over the
town.
Crowds of evil demons and monsters,
Wolf spirits at all four gates.
Striped tigers are the commanders;
White−faced tiger−cats are senior officers.
Antlered stags carry documents around;
Cunning foxes walk along the streets.
Thousand−foot pythons slither round the walls;
Twenty−mile serpents occupy the roads.
At the base of high towers gray wolves shout commands;
Leopards speak in human voices by pavilions.
Standard−bearers and drummers−−all are monsters;
Mountain spirits patrol and stand sentry;
Crafty hares open shops to trade;
Wild boars carry their loads to do business.
What used to be the capital of a heavenly dynasty
Has now become a city of wolves and tigers.
Just as he was being overcome by terror the Great Sage heard a wind from behind him and turned quickly to
see the third demon chief raising a heaven−square halberd with a patterned handle to strike at his head.
Springing to his feet, the Great Sage struck back at the monster's face with his gold−banded cudgel. Both of
them were snorting with rage and fury as they ground their teeth and fought a wordless struggle. Monkey then
saw the senior demon chief giving out orders as he lifted his steel saber to hack at Pig. Pig was in such a rush
that he had to let the horse go as he swung his rake around to hit wildly back. Meanwhile the second demon
chief was thrusting with his spear at Friar Sand, who parried with his demon−quelling staff.
Journey to the West
Chapter 76 1070
The three demon chiefs and the three monks were now all fighting in single combat, ready to throw away their
lives. The sixteen junior devils obeyed their orders, each giving play to his talents as they grabbed hold of the
white horse and the luggage and crowded round Sanzang, lifting up his chair and carrying him straight to the
city.
"Your Senior Majesty, please decide what to do now we've captured the Tang Priest," they shouted. All the
demons of every rank on the city walls came rushing down to throw the city gates wide open. Every battalion
was ordered to furl its flag, silence its drums, and on no account shout war−cries or strike gongs.
"His Senior Majesty has given orders that the Tang Priest is not to be frightened. He can't endure being
scared. If he is, his flesh will turn sour and be inedible." The demons were all delighted to welcome Sanzang,
bowing and carrying him into the throne hall of the palace, where he was invited to sit in the place of honour.
They offered him tea and food as they bustled around him in attendance. The venerable elder felt dizzy and
confused as he looked about and saw no familiar faces.
If you don't know whether he was to escape with his life listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 77
The Demon Host Mistreats the Fundamental Nature
The One Body Pays His Respects to the Buddha
We will tell now not of the sufferings of the venerable Tang Elder but of the three demon chiefs in strenuous
combat with the Great Sage and his two brother disciples in the low hills to the East outside the city. It was
indeed a good hard battle, like an iron brush against a copper pan:
Six types of body, six types of weapon,
Six physical forms, six feelings.
The six evils arise from the six sense organs and the six desires;
The six gates to nirvana and the six ways of rebirth are struggling for victory.
In the thirty−six divine palaces spring comes of itself;
The six times six forms do not want to be named.
This one holding a gold−banded cudgel
Performs a thousand movements;
That one wielding a heaven−square halberd
Is exceptional in every way.
Pig is even more ferocious with his rake;
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1071
The second demon's spear−play is superb and effective.
There is nothing commonplace about young Friar Sand's staff
As he tries to inflict a blow that is fatal;
Sharp is the senior demon's saber
Which he raises without mercy.
These three are the true priest's invincible escorts;
The other three are evil and rebellious spirits.
At first the fight is not so bad,
But later it becomes more murderous.
All six weapons rise up by magic
To twist and turn in the clouds above.
They belch out in an instant clouds that darken the sky,
And the only sounds to be heard are roars and bellows.
After the six of them had been fighting for a long time evening was drawing in, and as the wind was also
bringing clouds it became dark very quickly. Pig was finding it harder and harder to see as his big ears were
covering his eyelids. His hands and feet were besides too slow for him to be able to hold off his opponent, so
he fled from the fight, dragging his rake behind him. The senior demon chief took a swing at him with his
sword that almost killed him. Luckily Pig moved his head out of the way, so that the blade only cut off a few
of his bristles. The monster then caught up with Pig, opened his jaws, picked Pig up by the collar, carried him
into the city and threw him to the junior demons to tie up and take to the throne hall. The senior demon chief
then rose back into the air by cloud to help the other two.
Seeing that things were going badly Friar Sand feinted with his staff and turned to flee only to be caught,
hands and all, when the second demon unraveled his trunk and noisily wrapped it round him. The demon took
him too into the city, ordering the junior demons to tie him up in the palace before rising up into the sky again
to tell the others how to catch Monkey. Seeing that both his brother disciples had been captured Monkey
realized that it was going to be impossible for him to hold out single−handed. Indeed:
A couple of fists can defeat a good hand,
But cannot a competent foursome withstand.
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1072
With a shout Brother Monkey pushed the three demons' weapons aside, set off his somersault cloud and fled.
When the third demon chief saw Monkey ride off by somersault he shook himself, resumed his real form,
spread his wings and caught up with the Great Sage. You may well ask how the demon could possibly catch
up with him. When Monkey made havoc in heaven all that time ago a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers had
failed to capture him. Because he could cover 36,000 miles in a single somersault of his cloud, none of the
gods had been able to catch up with him. But this evil spirit could cover 30,000 miles with one beat of his
wings, so that with two beats he caught up with Monkey and seized him. Monkey could not get out of the
demon's talons no matter how hard he struggled or how desperately he longed to escape. Even when he used
his transformation magic he still could not move. If he made himself grow the demon opened his grip but still
held firmly to him; and if he shrank the demon tightened his clutch. The demon took him back inside the city,
released his talons, dropped him into the dust, and told the fiendish hordes to tie him up and put him with Pig
and Friar Sand. The senior and the second demon chiefs both came out to greet the third chief, who went back
up into the throne hall with them. Alas! This time they were not tying Monkey up but sending him on his way.
It was now the second watch of the night, and after all the demons had exchanged greetings the Tang Priest
was pushed out of the throne hall. When he suddenly caught sight in the lamplight of his three disciples all
lying tied up on the ground the venerable master leaned down beside Brother Monkey and said through his
tears, "Disciple, when we meet with trouble you normally go off and use your magic powers to subdue the
monsters causing it. Now that you too have been captured can I survive, poor monk that I am?" As soon as Pig
and Friar Sand heard their master's distress they too began to howl together.
"Don't worry, Master," said Monkey with a hint of a smile, "and don't cry, brothers. No matter what they do
they won't be able to hurt us. When the demon chiefs have settled and are asleep we can be on our way."
"You're just making trouble again, brother," replied Pig. "We're trussed up with hempen ropes. If we do
manage to work them a bit loose they spurt water on them to shrink them again. You might be too skinny to
notice, but fat old me's having a terrible time. If you don't believe me take a look at my arms. The rope's cut
two inches deep into them. I'd never get away."
"Never mind hempen ropes," said Monkey with a laugh, "even if they were coconut cables as thick as a
rice−bowl they'd be no more than an autumn breeze to me. What's there to make a fuss about?"
As master and disciples were talking the senior demon could be heard saying, "Third brother, you really are
strong and wise. Your plan to capture the Tang Priest was brilliant and it worked."
"Little ones," he called, "Five of you carry water, seven scrub the pans, ten get the fire burning and twenty
fetch the iron steamer. When we've steamed the four monks tender for my brothers and me to enjoy we'll give
you juniors a piece so that you can all live for ever."
"Brother," said Pig, trembling, when he this, "listen. That evil spirit's planning to steam and eat us."
"Don't be afraid," said Monkey. "I'm going to find out whether he's an evil spirit still wet behind the ears or an
old hand."
"Brother," said Friar Sand, sobbing, "don't talk so big. We're next door to the king of Hell. How can you talk
about whether he's wet behind the ears or an old hand at a time like this?" The words were not all out of his
mouth before the second demon chief was heard to say, "Pig won't steam well."
"Amitabha Buddha!" said Pig with delight. "I wonder who's building up good karma by saying I won't steam
well."
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1073
"If he won't steam well," the third chief said, "skin him before steaming him." This panicked Pig, who
screamed at the top of his voice, "Don't skin me. I may be coarse but I'll go tender if you boil me."
"If he won't steam well," the senior demon chief said, "put him on the bottom tray of the steamer."
"Don't worry, Pig," said Monkey with a laugh, "he's wet behind the ears. He's no old hand."
"How can you tell?" Friar Sand asked.
"Generally speaking you should start from the top when steaming," Monkey replied. "Whatever's hardest to
steam should be put on the top tray. Add a bit of extra fuel to the fire, get up a good steam and it'll be done.
But put it at the bottom and lower the steam and you won't get the steam up even if you cook it for six months.
He must be wet behind the ears if he says that Pig should be put on the bottom tray because he's hard to cook."
"Brother," Pig replied, "if he followed your advice I'd be slaughtered alive. When he can't see the steam rising
he'll take the lid off, turn me over and make the fire burn hotter. I'll be cooked on both sides and half done in
the middle."
As they were talking a junior devil came in to report that the water was boiling. The senior chief ordered that
the monks be carried in, and all the demons acted together to carry Pig to the lowest shelf of the steamer and
Friar Sand to the second shelf.
Guessing that they would be coming for him next Brother Monkey freed himself and said, "This lamplight is
just right for some action." He then pulled out a hair, blew on it with magic breath, called, "Change!" and
turned it into another Monkey he tied up with the hempen rope while extracting his real self in spirit form to
spring into mid−air, look down and watch. Not realizing his deception, the crowd of demons picked up the
false Monkey they saw and carried him to the third tray of the steamer, near the top. Only then did they drag
the Tang Priest to the ground, tie him up, and put him into the fourth tray. As the dry firewood was stacked up
a fierce fire blazed.
"My Pig and Friar Sand can stand a couple of boilings," sighed the Great Sage up in the clouds, "but that
master of mine will be cooked tender as soon as the water boils. If I can't save him by magic he'll be dead in
next to no time."
The splendid Great Sage made a hand−spell in mid−air, said the magic words "Om the blue pure dharma
world; true is the eternal beneficence of Heaven," and summoned the Dragon King of the Northern Ocean to
him.
A black cloud appeared among the other clouds, and from it there came at once an answering shout, "Ao
Shun, the humble dragon of the Northern Ocean, kowtows in homage."
"Arise, arise," said Monkey. "I would not have ventured to trouble you for nothing. I've now got this far with
my master the Tang Priest. He's been captured by vicious monsters and put into an iron steamer to be cooked.
Go and protect him for me and don't let the steam harm him." The dragon king at once turned himself into a
cold wind that blew underneath the cooking pot and coiled around to shield it from all the heat of the fire.
Thus were the three of them saved from death.
As the third watch was drawing to an end the senior demon chief announced a decision. "My men," he said,
"we have worn out brains and brawn to capture the Tang Priest and his three disciples. Because of the trouble
we went to in escorting them we have not slept for four days and nights. I don't think that they'll be able to
escape now that they're tied up and being steamed. You are all to guard them carefully. Ten of your junior

Chapter 77 1074
devils are to take it in turns to keep the fires burning while we withdraw to our living quarters for a little rest.
By the fifth watch, when it's about to get light, they're bound to be cooked tender. Have some garlic paste, salt
and vinegar ready and wake us up; then we'll be able to eat them with a good appetite." The devils did as they
had been ordered while the three demon chiefs returned to their sleeping chambers.
Up in the clouds Brother Monkey clearly heard these instructions being given, so he brought his cloud down.
As there was no sound of voices from inside the steamer he thought, "The fire is blazing away and they must
be feeling hot. Why aren't they afraid? Why aren't they saying anything? Hmm... Could they have been
steamed to death? Let me go closer and listen." The splendid Great Sage shook himself as he stood on his
cloud and turned into a black fly. As he alighted on the outside of the iron steamer's trays to listen he heard
Pig saying inside, "What lousy luck! What lousy luck! I wonder whether we're being closed−steamed or
open−steamed."
"What do you mean by 'closed' and 'open,' brother?" Friar Sand asked.
"Closed steaming is when they cover the steamer and open steaming is when they don't," Pig replied.
"Disciples," said Sanzang from the top tray, "the cover is off."
"We're in luck!" said Pig. "We won't be killed tonight. We're being open−steamed." Having heard all three of
them talking Monkey realized that they were still alive, so he flew away, fetched the iron steamer lid and
placed it lightly on the steamer.
"Disciples," exclaimed Sanzang in alarm, "they've covered us up."
"That's done it," said Pig.
"That means closed steaming. We're bound to die tonight." Friar Sand and the venerable elder started to sob.
"Don't cry," said Pig. "A new shift of cooks has come on duty."
"How can you tell?" Friar Sand asked.
"I was delighted at first when they carried me here," Pig replied. "I've got a bit of a feverish chill and I wanted
warming up. But all we're getting at the moment is cold air. Hey! Mr. Cook, sir! What are you making such a
fuss about putting more firewood on for? Am I asking for what's yours?"
When Monkey heard this he could not help laughing to himself. "Stupid clod," he thought. "Being cold is
bearable. If it got hot you'd be dead. The secret will get out if he goes on talking. I'd better rescue him.... No!
I'd have to turn back into myself to rescue them, and if I did that the ten cooks would see me and start
shouting. That would disturb the old monsters and I'd be put to a lot more trouble. I'll have to use some magic
on the cooks first." Then a memory came back to him.
"When I was the Great Sage in the old days I once played a guessing game with the Heavenly King Lokapala
at the Northern Gate of Heaven and won some of his sleep insects off him. I've got a few left I can use on
them." He felt around his waist inside his belt and found that he had twelve of them left.
"I'll give them ten and keep two to breed from," Monkey thought. Then he threw the insects into the ten junior
devils' faces, where the insects went up their nostrils, so that they all started feeling drowsy, lay down and
went to sleep. One of them, however, who was holding a fire−fork slept very fitfully, kept rubbing his head
and face, pinching his nose and continuously sneezing. "That so−and−so knows a trick or two," thought
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1075
Monkey. "I'll have to give him a double dose." He threw one of his remaining insects into the demon's face.
"With two insects the left one can go in when the right one comes out and vice versa," Monkey thought. "That
should keep him quiet." With that the junior demon gave two or three big yawns, stretched himself, dropped
the fork and slumped down, fast asleep. He did not get up again.
"What marvellous magic; it really works," said Monkey, turning back into himself. Then he went close to the
steamer and called, "Master."
"Rescue me, Wukong," said the Tang Priest when he heard him.
"Is that you calling to us from outside?" Friar Sand asked.
"If I weren't out here would you prefer me to be suffering in there with you?" Monkey replied.
"Brother," said Pig, "you slipped off and left us to carry the can. We're being closed−steamed in here."
"Stop yelling, idiot," said Monkey with a laugh. "I'm here to rescue you."
"Brother," said Pig, "if you're going to rescue us do it properly. Don't get us put back in here for another
steaming." Monkey then took the lid off, freed the master, shook the hair of his that he had turned into an
imitation Monkey and put it back on his body, then released Friar Sand and Pig, taking one tray at a time. As
soon as he was untied, the idiot wanted to run away.
"Don't be in such a hurry!" said Monkey, who recited the words of a spell that released the dragon before
going on to say to Pig, "We've still got high mountains and steep ridges ahead of us on our way to the Western
Heaven. The going's too heavy for the master−−he isn't a strong walker. Wait till I've fetched the horse."
Watch him as with light step he goes to the throne hall, where he saw that all the demons young and old were
asleep. He undid the rope attached to the horse's reins, being even more careful not to alarm him. Now the
horse was a dragon horse, so had Monkey been a stranger he would have given him a couple of flying kicks
and whinnied. But Monkey had kept horses and held the office of Protector of the Horses, and this horse was
besides their own. That was why the animal neither reared nor whinnied. Monkey led the horse very quietly
over, tightened the girth and got everything ready before inviting his master to mount. Trembling and shaking,
the Tang Priest did so. He too wanted to go.
"Don't you be in such a hurry either," Monkey said. "There'll be plenty more kings along our journey West
and we'll need our passport if we're to get there. What other identity papers do we have? I'm going back to
find the luggage."
"I remember that when we came in the monsters put the luggage to the left of the throne hall," said the Tang
Priest. "The loads must still be there."
"Understood," said Monkey, who sprang off at once to search for it by the throne hall. When he suddenly saw
shimmering lights of many colours Brother Monkey knew that they came from the luggage. How did he
know? Because the light came from the night−shining pearl on the Tang Priest's cassock. He rushed towards it
and found that their load was unopened, so he took it out and gave it to Friar Sand to carry. While Pig guided
the horse, the Great Sage took the lead.
They were hurrying to go straight out through the main Southern gate when they heard the noise of
watchmen's clappers and bells. They found the gates locked and paper seals over the locks.
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1076
"How are we going to get out if the place is so closely guarded?" Monkey wondered.
"Let's get out the back door," said Pig. With Monkey leading the way they rushed straight to the back gates.
"I can hear clappers and bells outside the back gates as well, and they're sealed too," Monkey said. "What are
we to do? If it weren't for the Tang Priest's mortal body it wouldn't bother us three: we could get away by
cloud and wind. But the Tang Priest hasn't escaped from the Three Worlds and is still confined within the Five
Elements. All his bones are the unclean ones he got from his mother and father. He can't lift himself into the
air and he'll never get away."
"No time for talking now, brother," said Pig: "Let's go somewhere where there aren't any bells, clappers or
guards, lift the master up and climb over the wall."
"That won't do," said Monkey. "We could lift him over now because we've got to, but you've got such a big
mouth you'd tell people everywhere when we're taking the scriptures back that we're the sort of monks who
sneak over people's walls."
"But we can't bother about behaving properly now," replied Pig. "We've got to save our skins." Monkey had
no choice but to do as he suggested, so they went up to wall and worked out how to climb over.
Oh dear! Things would have to work out this way: Sanzang was not yet free of his unlucky star. The three
demon chiefs who had been fast asleep in their living quarters suddenly awoke and, fearing that the Tang
Priest had escaped, got up, threw on their clothes and hurried to the throne hall of the palace.
"How many times has the Tang Priest been steamed?" they asked. The junior devils who were looking after
the fires were all so soundly asleep because the sleep insects were in them that not even blows could wake
them up.
The chiefs woke up some others who were not on duty, who answered rashly, "Ss...ss...seven times." Then
they rushed over to the steamer to see the steamer trays lying scattered on the floor and the cooks still asleep.
In their alarm they rushed back to report, "Your Majesties, th...th...they've escaped."
The three demon chiefs came out of the throne hall to take a close look around the cauldron. They saw that the
steamer trays were indeed scattered on the floor, the water was stonecold and the fire completely out. The
cooks supposed to be tending the fire were still so fast asleep that they were snoring noisily.
The fiends were all so shocked that they all shouted, "Catch the Tang Priest! At once! Catch the Tang Priest!"
Their yells woke up the demons senior and junior all around. They rushed in a crowd to the main front gates
carrying their swords and spears.
Seeing that the sealed locks had not been touched and that the night watchmen were still sounding their
clappers and bells they asked the watchman, "Which way did the Tang Priest go?"
"Nobody's come out," the watchmen all replied. They hurried to the back gates of the palace, only to find that
the seals, locks, clappers and bells were the same as at the front. With a great commotion they grabbed
lanterns and torches, making the sky red and the place as bright as day. The four of them were clearly lit up as
they climbed over the wall.
"Where do you think you're going?" the senior demon chief shouted, running towards them and so terrifying
the reverend gentleman that the muscles in his legs turned soft and numb and he fell off the wall to be
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1077
captured by the senior demon. The second demon chief seized Friar Sand and the third knocked Pig over and
captured him. The other demons took the luggage and the white horse. Only Monkey escaped.
"May Heaven kill him," Pig grumbled under his breath about Monkey. "I said that if he was going to rescue us
he ought to do a thorough job of it. As it is we're going to be put back in the steamer for another steaming."
The monsters took the Tang Priest into the throne hall but did not steam him again. The second demon chief
ordered that Pig was to be tied to one of the columns supporting the eaves in front of the hall and the third
chief had Friar Sand tied to one of the columns holding up the eaves at the back. The senior chief clung to the
Tang Priest and would not let go of him.
"What are you holding him for, elder brother?" the third demon asked. "Surely you're not going to eat him
alive. That wouldn't be at all interesting. He's no ordinary idiot to be gobbled up just to fill your stomach. He's
a rare delicacy from a superior country. We should keep him till we have some free time one rainy day, then
bring him out to be carefully cooked and enjoyed with drinking games and fine music."
"A very good suggestion, brother," replied the senior demon with a smile, "but Sun the Novice would come
and steal him again."
"In our palace we have a Brocade Fragrance Pavilion," said the third demon, "and in the pavilion is an iron
chest. I think we should put the Tang Priest into the chest, shut up the pavilion, put out a rumour that we have
already eaten him half raw and get all the junior devils in the city talking about it. That Sun the Novice is
bound to come back to find out what's happening, and when he hears this he'll be so miserably disappointed
that he'll go away. If he doesn't come to make trouble for another four or five days we can bring the Tang
Priest out to enjoy at our leisure. What do you think?"
The senior and second demon chiefs were both delighted. "Yes, yes, you're right, brother," they said. That
very night the poor Tang Priest was taken inside the palace, put into the chest and locked up in the pavilion.
We will not tell how the rumour was spread and became the talk of the town.
Instead the story tells how Monkey escaped that night by cloud, unable to look after the Tang Priest. He went
straight to Lion Cave where he wiped out all the tens of thousands of junior demons with his cudgel to his
complete satisfaction. By the time he had hurried back to the city the sun was rising in the East. He did not
dare challenge the demons to battle because
No thread can be spun from a single strand;
Nobody can clap with a single hand.
So he brought his cloud down, shook himself, turned himself into a junior demon and slipped in through the
gates to collect news in the streets and back alleys. "The Tang Priest was eaten raw by the senior king during
the night," was what all the people in the city were saying wherever he went. This made Brother Monkey
really anxious. When he went to look at the throne hall in the palace he saw that there were many spirits
constantly coming and going. They were wearing leather and metal helmets and yellow cotton tunics. In their
hands they held red lacquered staves, and ivory passes hung at their waists.
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1078
"These must be evil spirits who are allowed in the inner quarters of the palace," thought Monkey. "I'll turn
myself into one, go in and see what I can find out."
The splendid Great Sage then made himself identical to the demons and slipped in through the inner gates of
the palace. As he was walking along he saw Pig tied to one of the columns of the throne hall, groaning.
"Wuneng," Monkey said, going up to him.
"Is that you, brother?" asked the idiot, recognizing his voice. "Save me!"
"I'll save you," said Monkey. "Do you know where the master is?"
"He's done for," Pig replied. "The evil spirits ate him raw last night." At this Monkey burst into sobs and the
tears gushed out like water from a spring.
"Don't cry, brother," said Pig. "I've only heard the junior devils gossiping. I didn't see it with my own eyes.
Don't waste any more time. Go on and find out more." Only then did Monkey dry his tears and go to search in
the inner part of the palace.
Noticing Friar Sand tied to a column at the back of the palace he went up to him, felt his chest and said,
"Wujing."
Friar Sand also recognized his voice and said, "Brother, is that you here in disguise? Save me! Save me!"
"Saving you will be easy," said Monkey, "but do you know where the master is?"
"Brother!" said Friar Sand in tears. "The evil spirits couldn't even wait to steam the master. They've eaten him
raw."
Now that both of them had told him the same story the Great Sage was cut to the heart. Instead of rescuing Pig
and Friar Sand he sprang straight up into the sky and went to the mountain East of the city, where he landed
his cloud and let himself weep aloud.
"Poor Master," he said:
"I fought against heaven, was caught in its net,
Till you came along and delivered me, Master.
It became my ambition to worship the Buddha;
I strove to eliminate fiendish disaster.
"I never imagined that now you'd be murdered
And I would have failed on your journey to keep you.
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1079
The lands of the West were too good for your fate.
Your life's at an end: in what way can I help you?"
Deep in misery, Monkey said to himself, "It's all the fault of our Buddha, the Tathagata, who had nothing
better to do in his paradise than make the three stores of scriptures. If he really wanted to convert people to be
good he ought to have sent them to the East himself. Then they would have been passed on for ever. But he
couldn't bring himself to part with them. He had to make us go to fetch them. Who'd ever have thought that
after all the trouble of crossing a thousand mountains the master would lose his life here today? Oh well! I'll
ride my somersault cloud to see the Tathagata Buddha and tell him what's happened. If he's willing to give me
the scriptures to deliver to the East then the good achievement will be propagated and we'll be able to fulfil
our vow. If he won't give me them I'll get him to recite the Band−loosening Spell. Then I can take the band
off, return it to him and go back to my own cave to play the king and enjoy myself again."
The splendid Great Sage jumped to his feet and went straight to India on his somersault cloud. In less than a
couple of hours he could see the Vulture Peak in the near distance, and an instant later he had landed his cloud
and was heading straight for the foot of the peak. He looked up and saw the four vajrapanis blocking his way
and asking him where he was going.
"There's something I want to see the Tathagata about," Monkey replied with a bow.
Next he was faced by the Vajrapani Yongzhu, the indestructible king of Golden Glow Ridge on Mount
Kunlun, who shouted, "Macaque, you're an outrage! When the Bull Demon King was giving you such terrible
trouble we all helped you, but now you've come to see us today you're showing no manners at all. If you're
here on business you should submit a memorial first and wait till you're summoned before going any further.
This isn't like the Southern Gate of Heaven, where you can come and go as you please. Clear off! Out of the
way!"
Being told off like this when he was feeling so depressed drove Monkey into thundering roars of fury, and his
uncontrollable shouts and yells soon disturbed the Tathagata.
The Tathagata Buddha was sitting on his nine−level lotus throne expounding the sutras to his eighteen arhats
when he said, "Sun Wukong is here. You must all go out to receive him." In obedience to the Buddha's
command the arhats went out in two columns with their banners and canopies.
"Great Sage Sun," they said in greeting, "the Tathagata has commanded us to summon you to his presence."
Only then did the four vajrapanis at the monastery gates step aside to let Monkey enter. The arhats led him to
the foot of the lotus throne, where he went down to kowtow on seeing the Tathagata. He was sobbing and
weeping.
"Wukong," said the Buddha, "what makes you weep so miserably?"
"Your disciple has often received the grace of your instruction," Brother Monkey replied, "and has committed
himself to the school of Lord Buddha. Since being converted to the true achievement I have taken the Tang
Priest as my master and been protecting him on our journey. No words could describe what we have suffered.
We have now reached the city of Leonia near Lion Cave on Lion Mountain where three vicious monsters, the
Lion King, the Elephant King and the Great Roc, seized my master. All of us disciples of his were in a very
bad way too, tied up and put in a steamer to suffer the agony of fire and boiling water. Fortunately I was able
to get away and summon a dragon king to save the others. But we could not escape our evil star: the master
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1080
and the others were recaptured when I was trying to sneak them out last night. When I went back into the city
this morning to find out what had happened I learned that those utterly evil and ferocious monsters ate my
master raw during the night. Nothing is left of his flesh and bones. On top of that my fellow−disciples
Wuneng and Wujing are tied up there and will soon be dead too. I'm desperate. That's why your disciple has
come to visit the Tathagata. I beg you in your great compassion to recite the Band−loosening Spell so that I
can take the band off my head and give it back to you. Let your disciple go back to the Mountain of Flowers
and Fruit and enjoy himself." Before he had finished saying this the tears welled up again. There was no end
to his howls of misery.
"Don't upset yourself so, Wukong," said the Tathagata with a smile. "You can't beat those evil spirits. Their
magical powers are more than you can handle. That is why you are so unhappy."
Monkey knelt below the Buddha and beat his breast as he replied, "Truly, Tathagata, I made havoc in Heaven
all those years ago and was called Great Sage. Never in all my life had I been beaten before I met these
vicious monsters."
"Stop being so sorry for yourself," said the Tathagata. "I know those evil spirits."
"Tathagata!" Monkey suddenly blurted out. "They say those evil spirits are relations of yours."
"Wicked macaque!" said the Tathagata. "How could an evil spirit be any relation of mine?"
"If they're not relations of yours how come you know them?" retorted Monkey with a grin.
"I know them because I see them with my all−seeing eyes," the Buddha replied. "The senior demon and the
second demon have masters. Ananda, Kasyapa, come here. One of you is to take a cloud to Mount Wutai and
the other to Mount Emei. Summon Manjusri and Samantabhadra to come and see me." The two arhats left at
once as they had been commanded. "They are the masters of the senior and the second demon chiefs. But the
third demon does have some connection with me."
"On his mother's or his father's side?" Monkey asked.
"When the primal chaos was first separated the heavens opened up in the hour of the rat and the earth at the
hour of the ox," the Buddha replied. "Mankind was born at the tiger hour. Then heaven and earth came
together again and all living creatures were born, including beasts that walk and birds that fly. The unicorn is
the most senior of the beasts that walk and the phoenix is the most senior of the birds that fly. When the
phoenixes combined their essential spirit they gave birth to the peafowl and the Great Roc. When the peafowl
came into the world she was the most evil of creatures and a man−eater. She could devour all the people for
fifteen miles around in a single mouthful. When I was cultivating my sixteen−foot golden body on the peak of
the snowy mountain she swallowed me as well. I went down into her belly. I wanted to escape through her
backside, but for fear of soiling my body I cut my way out through her backbone and climbed Vulture Peak. I
would have killed her, but all the Buddha host dissuaded me: to kill the peahen would have been like killing
my own mother. So I kept her at my assembly on Vulture Peak and appointed her as the Buddha−mother, the
Great Illustrious Peahen Queen Bodhisattva. The Great Roc was born of the same mother as she was. That is
why we are relations of a kind."
When Monkey heard this he said with a smile, "By that line of argument, Tathagata, you're the evil spirit's
nephew."
"I shall have to go and subdue that demon in person," the Tathagata said. Monkey kowtowed as he
respectfully replied, "I beg you to condescend to grant us your illustrious presence."
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1081
The Tathagata then came down from his lotus throne and went out through the monastery gates with all the
Buddha host just as Ananda and Kasyapa arrived bringing Manjusri and Samantabhadra. These two
Bodhisattvas bowed to the Tathagata, who asked them, "How long have your animals been away from your
mountains, Bodhisattvas?"
"Seven days," said Manjusri.
"A mere seven days on your mountains is several thousand years in the mortal world," the Tathagata replied.
"Goodness knows how many living beings they have destroyed there. Come with me to recapture them at
once."
The two Bodhisattvas traveled at the Buddha's left and right hand as they flew through the air with the host.
This is what could be seen:
The shimmering clouds of blessing parted for Lord Buddha
As in his great compassion he came down from his shrine.
He taught the truth about all beings since creation,
Explaining how everything had been transformed in time.
Before him went five hundred holy arhats;
Behind him were three thousand guardians of the faith.
Ananda and Kasyapa were both in close attendance;
Samantabhadra and Manjusri came to conquer monsters.
The Great Sage had been granted this favour and succeeded in bringing the Lord Buddha and his host with
him. It was not long before the city was in sight. "Tathagata," said Monkey, "that's Leonia, where the black
vapors are coming from."
"You go down into the city first," said the Tathagata, "and start a fight with the evil spirits. Do not win. You
must lose and come back up. Leave it to us to recapture them."
The Great Sage then brought his cloud straight down to land on the city wall, where he stood on the
battlements and shouted abusively, "Evil beasts! Come out and fight me at once!" This caused such
consternation among the junior demons in the towers on the wall that they jumped straight down into the city
to report, "Your Majesties, Sun the Novice is on the wall, challenging us to battle."
"That ape hasn't been here for two or three days," the senior demon replied. "Now he's back challenging us to
battle. Can he have fetched some reinforcements?"
"He's nothing to be scared of," said the third demon chief. "Let's all go and have a look." The three chieftains,
all carrying their weapons, hurried up on the wall where they saw Monkey. Without a word they raised their
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1082
weapons and thrust at him. Monkey held them off by swinging his iron cudgel. When they had fought seven
or eight rounds Monkey feigned defeat and fled.
"Where do you think you're going?" the demon king asked with a mighty shout, and with a somersault
Monkey sprang up into mid−air. The three spirits went after him on clouds, but Monkey slipped aside and
disappeared completely in the Lord Buddha's golden aura.
All that could be seen were the images of the Three Buddhas of Past, Future and Present, the five hundred
arhats and the three thousand Protectors of the Faith who spread all around, encircling the three demon kings
so closely that not even a drop of water could leak through.
"This is terrible, my brother," said the senior demon chief, lashing out wildly, "that ape is a really sharp
operator. How did he manage to bring my master here?"
"Don't be afraid, elder brother," said the third demon. "If we all charge together we can cut down the
Tathagata with our swords and spears and seize his Thunder Monastery." The demons, who had no sense of
proper behavior, really did raise their swords to charge forward, hacking wildly.
Manjusri and Samantabhadra recited the words of a spell and shouted, "Won't you repent now, evil beasts?
What else do you hope for?" The senior and the second demon chiefs gave up the struggle, threw down their
weapons, rolled and reverted to their true images. The two Bodhisattvas threw their lotus thrones on the
demons' backs and flew over to sit on them. The two demons then gave up and submitted.
Now that the blue lion and the white elephant had been captured only the third evil monster was still
unsubdued. Spreading its wings it dropped its heaven−square halberd and rose straight up to try to catch the
Monkey King with a swing of its sharp talons, but as the Great Sage was biding in the golden aura the demon
dared get nowhere near him. When the Tathagata realized what it was trying to do he made his golden aura
flash and shook his head, the supreme meditator in the wind, to turn the creature into a bright red lump of
bloody meat. The evil spirit seized it with a flourish of its sharp talons, whereupon the Lord Buddha pointed
upwards with his hand, destroying the muscles in the monster's wings. It could not fly or get away from the
top of the Buddha's head, and it reverted to its true appearance as a golden−winged vulture.
Opening its beak it said to the Buddha, "Tathagata, why did you use your great dharma powers to catch me
like this?"
"You have been doing much evil here," the Tathagata replied. "Come with me and you will win credit for a
good deed."
"You eat vegetarian food in great poverty and suffering at your place," the evil spirit replied, "but here I can
eat human flesh and live in no end of luxury. If you kill me by starvation you'll be guilty of a sin."
"In the four continents I control countless living beings who worship me," the Buddha replied, "and whenever
they are going to perform a service to me I shall tell them to make a sacrifice to you first." The Great Roc
would have escaped and got away if it could. As it was he had no choice but to accept conversion.
Only then did Monkey emerge to kowtow to the Tathagata and say, "Lord Buddha, today you have captured
the evil spirits and removed a great bane, but my master is dead."
At this the Great Roc said bitterly as it ground its teeth, "Damned ape! Why did you have to bring these
ferocious men here to persecute me? I never ate that old monk of yours. He's in the Brocade Fragrance
Pavilion now, isn't he?" When Monkey heard this he quickly kowtowed to thank the Lord Buddha. Not daring
Journey to the West
Chapter 77 1083
to release the Great Roc, the Buddha made him into a guardian of the dharma in his brilliant halo then led his
host back to his monastery on their clouds. Monkey landed his cloud and went straight into the city, where
there was not a single junior demon left. Indeed:
A snake cannot move without its head;
A bird cannot fly without its wings.
They had all fled for their lives when they saw the Buddha capturing their evil kings.
Monkey then freed Pig and Friar Sand, found the luggage and the horse, and said to his fellow−disciples, "The
master hasn't been eaten. Come with me." He took the two of them straight into the inner compound where
they found the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion. Opening the door and looking inside they saw an iron trunk from
which could be heard the sound of Sanzang weeping.
Friar Sand used his demon−quelling staff to open the iron cage over the chest and raise its lid. "Master," he
called.
At the sight of them Sanzang wept aloud and said, "Disciples, how were the demons beaten? How did you
manage to find me here?" Monkey told him all the details of what had happened from beginning to end and
Sanzang expressed boundless gratitude. Then master and disciples found some rice in the palace and ate their
fill of it before packing their things and leaving the city along the main road West. Indeed:
Only a true man can find the true scriptures;
The will's shouts and the heart's labors are in vain.
If you don't know when on this journey they were to see the Tathagata listen to the explanation in the next
installment.

One can only wash away each speck of dust,
Tidy everything and polish well.
Sweep all causation away and come to nirvana;
Waste no time and destroy the thousand demons.
You surely will be free from obstructions,
And rise to the Daluo Heaven when your deeds are done.
The story tells how the Great Sage Sun used all his ingenuity to fetch the Tathagata to subdue the demons and
rescue Sanzang and the other two disciples, after which they left the city of Leonia and headed West. When
they had been travelling for several more months it was winter, and this is what could be seen:
The plum on the ridge was like broken jade
As the water in the pond slowly turned to ice.
All the red autumn leaves had fallen,
And the green of the pine looked fresher than ever.
The pale and scudding clouds were on the point of snowing;
Flat lay the withered grass upon the hills.
As far as the eye could see was chilly brightness
As the unseen cold went right into the bone.
Master and disciples braved the cold, sleeping out in the rain and dining off the wind, until as they were
walking along another walled and moated city came into sight. "What sort of place is that over there,
Wukong?" Sanzang asked Monkey, who replied, "We'll know when we get there. If it's the capital of a
Western kingdom we'll have to present our passport to be inspected and returned. If it's a prefecture or county
town we'll go straight through." Before master and disciples could finish their conversation they had arrived at
the city gates.
Sanzang dismounted and the four of them went in through the curtain wall outside the gates. Noticing an old
soldier sleeping shielded from the wind under the South−facing wall, Brother Monkey went up to him, shook
him and said, "Sir!"
When the old soldier awoke with a start to open his bleary eyes and see Monkey he fell to his knees to
kowtow and say, "My Lord!"
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1085
"There's no need for such alarm," said Monkey. "I'm no evil god, so why call me your lord?"
"Aren't you Lord Thunder God?" the old soldier asked, kowtowing again.
"What a thing to say," Monkey replied. "We're monks from the East on our way to fetch the scriptures from
the Western Heaven. We've just arrived here. Could I ask what this place is called?" This answer finally eased
the old soldier's mind.
With a yawn he got back on his feet, stretched and said, "Please forgive me, reverend gentlemen. This country
used to be called Bhiksuland but its name has been changed to Boytown."
"Do you have a king?" Monkey asked.
"Yes, yes," the old soldier replied.
Monkey then turned to report to the Tang Priest, "This country used to be called Bhiksuland but the name's
been altered to Boytown, though I don't know what the change signifies."
"If it was Bhiksuland before why is it Boytown now?" the Tang Priest wondered.
"I expect there was a King Bhiksu who died," said Pig, "and they changed the name to Boytown when a boy
succeeded him."
"Impossible," said the Tang Priest, "impossible. Let's go in and make some enquiries in the street."
"That's right," said Friar Sand. "The old soldier wouldn't have known anyhow, and on top of that elder brother
gave him such a fright that he talked nonsense. We'll ask some more questions in the city."
When they had gone through the third pair of gates they came to a great market on a main street. The people
were well−dressed and their bearing distinguished.
A hubbub of voices came from bar and music hall;
High hung the curtains outside splendid shop and teahouse.
Business was good in firms by the thousand;
Wealth flowed free in shopping street and market.
The dealers in metal and silk were swarming like ants,
Caring only for money while struggling for fame and wealth.
With these noble manners, magnificent scenery
And peaceful waters it was a time of prosperity.
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1086
The master and his three disciples, who were leading the horse and carrying the baggage, spent some time
walking around the streets as they admired the general air of prosperity. In the entrance to every house there
was a basketwork coop of the sort geese are kept in. "Disciples," said Sanzang, "why do all the people here
put coops in their gateways?" Pig's response to this was to look around and see that there were indeed lines of
coops hung with satin curtains of many colours. "Master," said the idiot with a smile, "today must be a lucky
one for weddings and celebrations. Everybody's having a wedding."
"Nonsense," said Monkey. "How could every single family possibly be having a wedding? There must be
some other reason for this. I'm going over to take a look."
"You're not to go," said Sanzang, grabbing hold of him. "You look so ugly that people might take offence."
"I'll go as something else," Brother Monkey replied.
Making a spell with his hands the splendid Great Sage said the words of a spell, shook himself, turned into a
bee, spread his wings, flew to one of the coops and slipped in through the curtains to take a look. A little boy
was sitting inside. Monkey looked inside another family's coop and there was a child in that too. He inspected
eight or nine households and all of them had a child. All were boys: there was not a single girl. Some were
sitting up in their coops and playing and some were crying; some were eating fruit and some were snoozing.
His inspection over, Monkey turned back into his normal self and reported to the Tang Priest, "There are little
boys in the coops. The oldest is under six and the youngest only four. I don't know why they're here." Sanzang
wondered what the explanation could be.
Turning a comer they saw the gateway to an official building. It was a government hostel with golden
pavilions. The venerable elder was delighted.
"Disciples," he said, "we will go into this hostel. We can find out where we are, give the horse a rest and put
up for the night."
"Yes, that's right," said Friar Sand. "Let's go straight in." This the four of them happily did, a fact that the
officials there reported to the hostel's superintendent.
When the superintendent had led them inside greetings had been exchanged and they had all sat down, the
superintendent asked, "Where have you come from, reverend sir?"
"I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven," Sanzang
replied. "Now that we have arrived at this excellent establishment I will of course present my passport for
inspection. Could we, I wonder, impose on your hospitality for the night?"
The superintendent ordered tea, and when it had been drank he saw to their entertainment and told the staff
who were on duty to look after the pilgrims. After thanking him for this Sanzang went on to ask, "Could we
go to the palace today to see His Majesty and have our passport inspected?"
"That will not be possible this evening," the superintendent replied. "It will have to wait until tomorrow
morning. I hope that you will spend a comfortable night in this humble hostel."
A little later, when all had been prepared, the superintendent of the hostel invited the four travelers to take a
vegetarian meal with him. He also told his staff to sweep out the guest rooms for them to spend the night in.
Sanzang expressed endless gratitude. When they were all seated the venerable elder said, "I wonder if I could
trouble you for information on something that I cannot understand. How do you raise children in your
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1087
country?"
"People are the same the whole world over, just as there are never two suns in the sky," the superintendent
replied. "Children are born when their time comes after the father's seed has joined with the mother's blood
and they have been in the womb for ten lunar months. After they are born they are suckled for three years and
their bodies gradually grow. Everybody knows that."
"What you tell me is no different from how they grow in my humble country," Sanzang replied. "But when we
came into the city we saw a goose coop with a little boy inside in front of every house in the street. This is
something I cannot understand, which is why I ventured to raise the question."
"Ignore that, reverend sir," whispered the hostel superintendent into Sanzang's ear. "Don't ask about it. Put it
out of your mind. Don't even mention it. Would you like to settle down for the night before starting your
journey again tomorrow morning?" Sanzang's response was to seize hold of the superintendent and demand an
explanation.
"Watch your words," the superintendent replied, shaking his head and wagging his finger, but Sanzang was
not going to drop the matter. He insisted on being told all the details. The superintendent had no choice but to
dismiss all the staff on duty.
When they were alone under the lamplight he whispered to Sanzang, "The goose coops you asked about are
there because our king is a bad ruler. Why ever do you have to keep asking about it?"
"How is he a bad ruler?" Sanzang asked. "I will not be able to set my mind at ease until you give me an
explanation."
"This country is really called Bhiksuland," the superintendent replied. "Boytown is only what the people have
started calling it. Three years ago an old man dressed as a Taoist came here with a girl just fifteen years old.
She was a ravishing beauty, just like a Bodhisattva Guanyin. He presented her to our present king, who was so
smitten by her charms that she became the favorite of all his women. She was given the title Queen Beauty.
For some time now he's had no eyes for any of his other queens or consorts. He's so insatiable that he's been at
it day and night. The result is nervous exhaustion and physical collapse. He's eating and drinking next to
nothing. He might die at any moment. The Royal College of Physicians has tried every possible medicine
without any success. The Taoist who presented the girl to the king was rewarded with the title of Elder of the
Nation. He has a secret foreign formula for making people live a great deal longer. He's been to ten continents
and the three magic islands to collect the ingredients. Everything is ready. The only problem is that it needs a
terrible adjuvant to help it−−a potion made from the hearts of 1,111 little boys. When he's taken it he'll have a
thousand years of vigorous life ahead of him. All the little boys being kept in the coops are the ones that have
been chosen. Their parents are so afraid of the king that none of them dares weep. That's why they've put out
the story that this place is now called Boytown. When you go to the palace tomorrow morning, reverend sir,
you must only present your passport to be inspected and returned. Say nothing about any of this." When he
had said all this he left them.
Sanzang was so horrified by what he had heard that his bones turned soft and his muscles went numb. He
could not help the tears that streamed down his face as he started sobbing aloud. "Foolish king," he exclaimed,
"foolish king. Your lechery has ruined your health, and now you are planning to destroy all those young lives.
How could you? What misery! The pain of it all is killing me." There is a poem about it that goes:
The wicked monarch's folly makes him forget the truth;
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1088
His health is ruined by his unbridled lusts.
Pursuing eternal life by killing little children,
He slaughters his subjects to avoid Heaven's punishment.
This is all more than the merciful monk can bear:
He cannot accept the official's worldly wisdom.
Long are his sighs as he weeps in the lamplight;
Stricken with grief is the Buddha worshipper.
"Master," said Pig, going up to him, "what's the matter with you? What you're doing is like taking a stranger's
coffin to your own home and weeping over it. Don't upset yourself like that. As the rhyme goes,
When a monarch insists that his subjects will die
None that are loyal to live will aspire;
When a father commands his own offspring to perish
Any dutiful son will most surely expire.
The people he's going to kill are his own subjects. What are they to you? Take off your clothes, get some sleep
and 'don't worry about the ancients.'"
"Disciple," said Sanzang, his tears still flowing, "you haven't a shred of compassion. The most important thing
for us monks as we accumulate good deeds is to help others. How could this deluded king be so set in his
wickedness? Never have I ever heard that eating human hearts could prolong life. How could something so
terrible not grieve me?"
"Don't grieve so, Master," said Friar Sand. "When you present our passport tomorrow and seethe king you can
talk to him about it. Even if he doesn't accept your advice you'll be able to see what the Elder of the Nation
looks like. Probably he's an evil spirit who's thought all this up because he wants to eat human hearts."
"Wujing is right," said Brother Monkey. "Go to bed now, Master, and tomorrow morning I'll go to court with
you to see what this Elder of the Nation is like. If he's human he's probably a heretic who doesn't follow
orthodox ways but believes in drugs, and I'll convert him with the essential teachings of intrinsic nature. If
he's an evil spirit I'll catch him, show the king what he is, and urge the king to control his desires and build up
his strength. Whatever happens I won't let him kill those children."
As soon as he heard this Sanzang bowed to Monkey with great courtesy and said, "What an excellent
suggestion! But when we see the deluded king we must say nothing about this in case he thinks we are guilty
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1089
of not knowing our place and spreading slander. What could we do if that happened?"
"I've got my magic powers," Monkey replied. "First of all I'm going to get the little boys in the coops away
from the city so that he'll have nobody to take the hearts out of tomorrow. The local officials will of course
report this and the king will be bound either to order a discussion with the Elder of the Nation or else to
demand more information. This will give us a chance to submit our memorial without getting ourselves into
trouble." Sanzang was very pleased.
"How are you going to get the children out of the town now?" he asked. "If you really can rescue them you
will be doing the greatest of good deeds, worthy disciple. But do it quick, because if you lose any time you
may be too late."
Summoning up his might Monkey stood up and gave Pig and Friar Sand their parting instructions: "Sit here
with the master while I do my stuff. If you notice a magical wind blowing that'll be the boys leaving the city."
Sanzang and the other two disciples said, "We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajya−guru Buddha. We invoke the
Saviour Bhaisajya−guru Buddha."
Once outside the doors the Great Sage whistled, rose into mid−air, made a spell with his hands and said the
magic words, called out "Om pure dharma world," and summoned the city god, the local deities, the
officiating immortals, the Protectors of the Faith of the four quarters and the center, the Four Duty Gods, the
Six Dings and the Six Jias and the Guardians of the Teaching.
They all came to him where he was in midair, bowed and said, "Great Sage, what is the urgent business on
which you have summoned us in the middle of the night?"
"My journey has brought me to Bhiksuland," Monkey replied, "where the king is a bad one who believes in
evil doctrines. He wants to take the hearts out of little boys to make the adjuvant to a medicine that he hopes
will make him live for ever. My master finds this utterly horrible and has asked me to rescue the boys and
destroy the demon. That is why I've asked all you gentlemen here. I want you to use your magical powers to
lift all the little boys, coops and all, over the city wall into a mountain hollow or somewhere deep in a forest.
Keep them there for a day or two. Give them fruit to eat and don't let them go hungry. Keep watch over them
in secret and don't frighten them or make them cry. When I've eliminated the evil, brought the country back to
good government and persuaded the king to mend his ways and am about to leave, you must bring them back
to me."
The gods all listened to their orders then brought their clouds down to land so that they could use their
magical powers. The city was filled with a blustering negative wind that brought with it an all−pervasive and
sinister fog.
All the stars in the sky were obscured by the negative wind;
The moon was blacked out by the magical fog for many a mile.
At first the wind was gusty,
And then it blew like a hurricane.
When it was gusting
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1090
All ran to the gateways to rescue their children;
Then in the hurricane
They wanted to save their own flesh and blood in the coops.
The air turned so chilly that none dared show their heads;
The cold was so piercing that clothes froze like iron.
Vainly did parents look all around;
The families all were stricken with grief.
The sinister wind blew right across the land
As the boys in their baskets were carried off by the gods.
Although that was a night of bereavement and grief
Joy was coming to all the next day.
There is another poem about it that goes:
Compassion has always been strong in the Sakyamuni faith;
The achievement of goodness explains the Great Vehicle.
A multitude of holy ones all accumulate goodness;
For the Three Refuges and Five Precepts harmony is needed.
The land of Bhiksu was not to be ruined by its monarch
When a thousand little boys were to forfeit their lives.
Monkey and his master had brought them to safety,
Which conferred more merit than the Great Wisdom.
By the third watch of the night the gods had carried all the coops off and hidden them in all the safe places.
Monkey then landed his auspicious light and went straight back to the government hostel, where to his secret
delight he could hear the other three still chanting, "We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajya−guru Buddha."
"Master," he said, going up to them, "I'm back. What was the negative wind like?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1091
"Terrific," said Pig.
"How did the rescue of the children go?" Sanzang asked.
"Every single one of them has been saved," Monkey replied. "They'll all be brought back when we set out
again." The master thanked him over and over again before finally going to sleep.
When Sanzang awoke at dawn he dressed himself in his best vestments and said, "Wukong, I am going to the
early audience to present our passport."
"If you go by yourself, Master," Monkey replied, "I'm afraid that you won't be able to manage. Let me go with
you. Then I'll be able to find out about the evil in this country."
"If you go you will refuse to pay homage," said Sanzang, "and the king may well take it amiss."
"I won't be seen," said Monkey. "I'll go with you in secret and protect you." This pleased Sanzang very much.
He had told Pig and Friar Sand to look after the luggage and horse and was just about to set out when the
superintendent of the hostel came in to see him. The superintendent was struck by the difference between
vestments he wore this day compared with what he had been wearing the day before.
His cassock was of brocade, set with exotic gems;
On his head he wore a gold−topped Vairocana mitre.
He held a nine−ringed monastic staff
And hid a divine radiance in his breast.
The passport was fastened tightly to his body,
Wrapped in brocade inside another cloth.
He moved like an arhat come down to earth;
His face was truly that of a living Buddha.
When the superintendent had greeted Sanzang courteously he murmured into his ear advice against meddling
in matters that were none of his business. Sanzang nodded and assented. The Great Sage stole to a place by
the gate, said the words of a spell, shook himself and turned into the tiniest of insects that flew with a
high−pitched hum to Sanzang's mitre.
Sanzang left the government hostel and headed straight for the palace.
Arriving at the palace gates Sanzang saw a eunuch officer to whom he bowed and said, "This humble monk
has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. Now that I have
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1092
reached your distinguished country I must present my passport to be inspected and returned. I beg Your
Excellency to report this to His Majesty." This the eunuch duly did.
The king was very pleased. "A monk from afar must be a holy man," he said, ordering that Sanzang be asked
in. When the venerable elder had paid his respects at the foot of the steps of the throne hall he was invited to
enter the hall and take a seat. Sanzang thanked the king and sat down. The king looked weak and enervated.
When he raised his hands to make a polite salutation he could not do so properly, and he was incapable of
continuous speech. His right was so blurred that he had to make several attempts to read the document that
Sanzang handed to him before he could sign, seal and return it to the Tang Priest, who put it away again.
The king was just about to ask why they were fetching the scriptures when one of his aides reported, "His
Excellency the Elder of the Nation is here." Leaning on one of his young eunuch attendants the king struggled
down from his throne to greet the Elder. Sanzang hastily got to his feet, stood to one side and looked round to
see that the Elder of the Nation was an aged Taoist who advanced with a swagger towards the steps of the
throne.
On his head he wore a goose−yellow silken cap,
Round his body a scented cloak of silk and crane feathers,
And at his waist a triple sash of blue velvet.
On his feet were sandals of hemp and grasscloth;
At the top of his rattan stick coiled a dragon.
The pouch at his chest was embroidered with dragon, phoenix and flowers.
His jadelike face radiated well−being;
A gray beard blew about his chin.
Flames shot from golden pupils
In eyes even longer than his eyebrows.
Clouds followed his steps
As he wandered through incense−laden mists.
The officials below the steps received him with obeisances,
Announcing the presence of the Elder of the Nation.
When he reached the throne hall the Elder of the Nation performed no obeisance but arrogantly strode straight
in. The king leaned forward in a bow and said, "We are most fortunate that you have condescended to make
your immortal way here, Elder of the Nation." He ordered that an embroidered stool be set on his left for the
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1093
Elder to sit on.
Taking a step forward Sanzang bowed and said, "Greetings, Elder of the Nation." The Elder sat majestically
on his seat, but instead of returning Sanzang's courtesy he turned to the king and asked, "Where's this monk
from?"
"He has been sent by the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven," the king
replied, "and is here to present his passport for inspection."
"The road West is dark and dismal," said the Elder of the Nation with a smile. "There's nothing good about it."
"The West has always been a land of bliss," Sanzang replied. "How could it not be good?"
"There is an old saying we once heard that monks are disciples of the Buddha," said the king. "I wonder
whether it is true that by being a monk and turning to the Buddha one can live for ever." When Sanzang heard
this he put his hands together and replied:
"One who becomes a monk gets away from all kinds of causation. By understanding nature he learns that all
dharmas are empty. Great wisdom is casual and drifts in non−living. The true secret is hidden; it wanders in
extinction. When the three worlds are empty all origins are ordered; when the six sense−organs are purified all
troubles are finished. To be resolute, single−minded and enlightened one must understand the heart. When the
heart is purified it can shine alone; when the heart is sincere all regions are imbued with it. The true
appearance has neither deficiency nor excess and can be seen in life. The images of illusion always decay.
Why seek what is beyond one's lot? The way to enter meditation is through meritorious deeds and by sitting in
silence; the root of cultivating one's conduct truly is charity and kindness. Great skill appears as clumsiness
and knows that all deeds are achieved through inaction. The finest plans involve no calculation; everything
must be left alone. It only needs one heart not to move for every action to be perfect. It is truly absurd to try to
strengthen the male by drawing on the female and nonsensical to try to extend one's years by taking elixirs.
The only essential is that all the causation of every speck of dust must be discarded and that every type of
matter should be empty. Live plain and pure; let your desires be few. Then naturally you will enjoy life
without end for ever."
When the Elder of the Nation heard this he laughed at it. "Phooey," he said, pointing at the Tang Priest,
"phooey! You're talking a load of rubbish, monk. Fancy you talking about understanding nature, and you a
member of the faith that preaches nirvana. You don't have any idea of where nature comes from. Sitting still
like a dead tree to enter dhyana is wasted effort as far as self−cultivation and tempering are concerned. In the
words of the saying,
Sit, sit, sit;
Your backside's split.
The fire's too hot;
Good that's not.
What you don't realize at all is this:
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1094
"One who cultivates immortality has strong bones; one who attains the Way has the most magical spirit.
Carrying his bowl and ladle he goes into the mountains to visit his friends; he picks every kind of herb to
succor humanity. He makes a rainhat from immortal flowers, plucks the fragrant orchid to make his bed. He
sings, claps and dances, then goes to sleep. When expounding the Way he teaches the doctrines of the
Supreme One; he eliminates the evil of the human world with holy water. He takes the finest breath of heaven
and earth, gathers the essence of the sun and moon. By controlling the negative and positive forces he creates
the elixir; through the mastery of fire and water the foetus is formed. On the sixteenth day of the month the
negative is eliminated, hazily and obscurely. In the twenty−seventh day of winter the positive begins to grow,
darkly and mysteriously. He gathers the herbs of each of the four seasons, refining his elixir to nourish the
nine transformations. Astride his blue phoenix he ascends to the purple palace; riding his white crane he goes
to the jasper capital. He visits all the splendors of Heaven, showing the efficacy of the wonderful Way. Just
compare it with the dhyana teachings of your Sakyamuni, your elimination of atman and your nirvana that
enables you to shuffle off your stinking husk. None of this lifts you out of the worldly dust. Among the Three
Teachings it is supreme; the Way alone has always been esteemed."
The king was delighted to hear this exposition, and all the court officials exclaimed with admiration, "That's
splendid, 'the Way alone has always been esteemed.'" Sanzang was overcome by humiliation at all this praise
going to his rival. The king then told his department of foreign relations to lay on a banquet of vegetarian food
for the monks from a far country when they left the city to travel West.
Sanzang thanked the king for his kindness and withdrew. As he was leaving the throne hall and going out of
the palace Monkey flew down from the top of his mitre to say into his ear, "Master, the Elder of the Nation is
an evil spirit, and the king has been bewitched. Go back to the hostel and wait for your meal while I get some
information here."
Sanzang understood this and left through the main gates of the palace.
Of him we will say no more. Watch Monkey as he flies straight to a jade screen in the throne hall and lands on
it. From the ranks of officials the military commanders of the capital stepped forward to report, "Your
Majesty, last night a cold wind carried away the little boys in their goose coops from every house in every
ward of the city. They have vanished without a trace, coops and all."
This report both alarmed and angered the king, who said to the Elder of the Nation, "Heaven must be
destroying us. We had the good fortune to be given the formula for your elixir after months of serious illness
that the royal physicians have been unable to cure. We were preparing to have the boys cut open at noon today
and their hearts taken out to be made into the adjuvant for the elixir. Never did we imagine that a cold wind
would blow them all away. If this is not Heaven destroying us what is it?"
"Don't upset yourself," the Elder of the Nation replied with a smile. "By blowing them away Heaven is giving
Your Majesty eternal life."
"How can you maintain that Heaven is giving me eternal life when they have just been blown away?" the king
asked.
"When I was coming to court this morning," the Elder of the Nation replied, "I saw a uniquely marvellous
adjuvant that will be far superior to 1,111 little boys' hearts. They would only lengthen Your Majesty's life by
a thousand years, but if you take my elixir with this other adjuvant you can live for a hundred million years."
The king was mystified about what this adjuvant could be, but only after repeated questions did the Elder of
the Nation reply, "The monk from the East who is being sent to fetch the scriptures has pure organs and
regular features. His is the body of one who has cultivated his conduct for ten lifetimes. He has been a monk
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1095
since childhood and has preserved his masculine purity, which all makes him ten thousand times better than
those little boys. If you can make a decoction from his heart with which to take my elixir I can guarantee you
an extremely long life."
When the deluded king heard this he believed it completely. "Why didn't you tell us before?" he said to the
Elder of the Nation. "If it's as good as you say we should have kept him when he was here just now and not let
him go."
"This will present no problem," the Elder of the Nation said. "You have already told the department of foreign
relations to give him a vegetarian banquet. He can't possibly leave the city before eating the meal. Urgent
orders must be issued to have the gates firmly closed. Send troops to surround the government hostel and
bring that monk here. First we will try to win his heart by treating him with courtesy. If he agrees we will cut
it out and give him a royal burial, build him a temple and make offerings to him. If he will not agree we'll use
rough methods. We can tie him up and cut it out. There will be no problem." The deluded ruler accepted this
suggestion and ordered that all the gates be closed. He then sent the officers and men of the royal guard to
surround the hostel.
Having found all this out Monkey flew straight to the hostel, turned back into himself and said to the Tang
Priest, "Something terrible's happened, Master, something terrible." Sanzang had just begun to eat the king's
vegetarian banquet with Pig and Friar Sand when this sudden announcement scattered his three bodily spirits
and made smoke come out of his seven orifices. He collapsed in the dust, pouring with sweat, and unable to
see clearly or speak.
Friar Sand was so alarmed he came forward to help him back to his feet, calling, "Wake up, Master, wake up."
"What's so terrible?" Pig asked. "What's so terrible? You should have broken the news gently instead of
giving the master such a scare."
"When the master left the palace I went back to keep an eye on things," Monkey replied. "That Elder of the
Nation is an evil spirit. A moment later the city garrison came to report about the cold wind carrying the little
boys away. This upset the king, but the Elder of the Nation cheered him up by saying that this was Heaven
giving him eternal life. He wants to use your heart as an adjuvant for the elixir of immortality, Master. The
deluded king has accepted this wicked suggestion and ordered his best troops to surround this hostel. He's also
sent an aide to ask you for your heart, Master."
"What a merciful and compassionate chap you are," said Pig with a laugh. "You saved the boys and made the
wind blow all right, but now you've got us in this disastrous mess."
Trembling and shaking, Sanzang dragged himself to his feet, seized hold of Monkey and said imploringly,
"Good disciple, how are we to get out of this?"
"If you want to get out of this," said Monkey, "there'll have to be a switch."
"What do you mean by a switch?" Friar Sand asked.
"If you want to survive," Monkey replied, "the disciple will have to become the master and the master the
disciple. Do that and we'll be safe."
"Save my life," said Sanzang, "and I will gladly become your disciple or even your disciple's disciple."
Journey to the West
Chapter 78 1096
"In that case there must be no hesitation," Monkey replied, continuing, "Pig, mix up some mud at once." The
idiot loosened some earth with his rake then, not daring to go outside for water, lifted his tunic to make some
water himself. With this he mixed up a lump of foul−smelling mud that he handed to Monkey. Monkey had
no option but to beat it out flat and press it against his face so that it looked like a monkey's face. Then he told
his master to stand up and neither move nor say anything while he placed the mask on his face, said the words
of a spell, blew a magic breath and said, "Change!"
The venerable elder now looked just like Monkey. He took off his own clothes and put on Monkey's while
Monkey dressed in his master's clothes, made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook himself and
made himself look just like the Tang Priest. Even Pig and Friar Sand could not tell that he really was not.
Just when they had completed the disguises together there came the sound of gongs and drums as a dense
forest of spears and swords appeared. The commanders of the royal guard had surrounded the hostel with their
three thousand men. A royal aide came into the main hall of the hostel to ask, "Where is the reverend
gentleman from the Tang court in the East?"
The superintendent of the hostel anxiously fell to his knees and said, pointing, "In the guest room over there."
The aide then went into the room and said, "Venerable elder from Tang, His Majesty has sent for you."
Pig and Friar Sand stood on either side of the imitation Monkey to guard him while the imitation Tang Priest
went out through the door, bowed and said, "Your Excellency, what does His Majesty wish to say to me?
Why has he sent for me?" The aide stepped forward to grab hold of him and say, "You and I are going to the
palace. His Majesty must have some use for you." Alas!
Wickedness was stronger than goodness and mercy;
Goodness and mercy only led to catastrophe.
If you don't know whether they were to survive this departure listen to the explanation in the next installment.

The Reigning Monarch Saves the Little Boys
The story tells how the royal aide dragged the imitation Tang Priest out of the government hostel and marched
him, heavily surrounded by royal guardsmen, straight to the gates of the palace, where he said to the eunuch
gate officer, "Please be so good as to report to His Majesty that we have brought the Tang Priest." The eunuch
officer hurried into the palace to pass this on to the deluded king, who ordered that they be brought in.
All the officials knelt at the foot of the steps to the throne hall, leaving the imitation Tang Priest standing
alone in the middle of them.
"King of Bhiksuland," he shouted, "what have you summoned me here to say to me?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1097
"We are sick with a chronic illness that has dragged on for many a day without any improvement," the king
replied. "Now the Elder of the Nation has to our good fortune presented us with a prescription that has been
made up. All that is needed now is an adjuvant. The reason we have sent for you, reverend sir, is to ask you
for the adjuvant. If we recover we will build a temple to you in which offerings will be made in all four
seasons and incense will be burnt to you in perpetuity by our country."
"I am a man of religion," the imitation Tang Priest replied, "and have brought nothing with me. I do not know
what adjuvant the Elder of the Nation has told Your Majesty you need."
"Your heart, reverend sir," the deluded monarch replied.
"I will be frank with Your Majesty," the imitation Tang Priest said. "I have a number of hearts. I don't know
which you want."
"Monk," pronounced the Elder of the Nation, who was standing beside the king. "I want your black heart."
"Very well then," the imitation Tang Priest replied. "Produce your knife at once and open up my chest. If there
is a black heart there I shall offer it to you obediently."
The deluded monarch thanked him delightedly and ordered an official in attendance to bring a small knife
with a blade shaped like a cow's ear that was handed to the imitation Tang Priest. Taking the knife, the
imitation Tang Priest undid his clothes, thrust out his chest, pressed his left hand against his abdomen and cut
the skin of his stomach open with the knife in his right hand. There was a whoosh, and out rolled a whole pile
of hearts. The civilian officials all turned pale with fright; the military officers were numbed.
When the Elder of the Nation saw this from inside the throne hall he said, "This monk is a suspicious−minded
character. He has too many hearts."
The imitation Tang Priest then held up the hearts one by one, each dripping with blood, for all to see. They
included a loyal red heart, a pure white heart, a yellow heart, an avaricious heart, a fame−hungry heart, a
jealous heart, a calculating heart, an over−competitive heart, an ambitious heart, an overbearing heart, a
murderous heart, a vicious heart, a frightened heart, a cautious heart, a heretical heart and a heart full of
indefinable gloom. There was every kind of evil heart except a black one. The deluded ruler was
horror−struck, unable to speak until he said in trembling tones, "Put them away! Put them away!"
The imitation Tang Priest had taken as much as he could, so he put his magic away and turned back into
himself to say to the deluded monarch, "Your Majesty, you're not at all perceptive. We monks all have good
hearts. It's only this Elder of the Nation of yours who has a black heart. His would make a good adjuvant for
the medicine. If you don't believe me I'll take his out to show you."
When the Elder of the Nation heard this he opened his eyes wide to take a careful look. He saw that the
monk's face had changed to something quite different. Heavens! Recognizing him as the Great Sage Monkey
who had been so famous five hundred years ago he made a getaway by cloud. Monkey did a somersault and
sprang up into mid−air to shout, "Where do you think you're going? Take this from me!" The Elder used his
stick with a dragon on its head to meet the blow from Monkey's cudgel. The two of them fought a fine battle
up in the sky:
The As−You−Will cudgel
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1098
And the dragon stick
Making clouds up in the sky.
The Elder of the Nation was really an evil spirit,
Using his fiendish daughter's seductive charms.
The king had made himself ill through his lust;
The monster wanted to butcher the boys.
There was no escape from the Great Sage's divine powers
To catch demons and to rescue their victims.
The cudgel's blows to the head were really vicious;
Splendid was the way in which the stick met them.
They fought so hard that the sky was full of mist,
Casting city and people into darkness and fear.
The souls of civil and military officials went flying;
The faces of the queens and concubines turned pale.
The deluded king tried desperately to hide,
Trembling and shaking, unable to do anything.
The cudgel was as fierce as a tiger from the mountains;
The staff whirled round like a dragon leaving the sea.
Now they made havoc in Bhiksuland
As good and evil were clearly set apart.
When the evil spirit had fought over twenty hard rounds with Monkey his dragon staff was no longer a match
for the gold−banded cudgel. Feinting with his staff, the spirit turned himself into a beam of cold light and
dropped into the inner quarters of the palace to take the demon queen he had presented to the king out through
the palace gates with him. She too turned into cold light and disappeared.
Bringing his cloud down, the Great Sage landed in the palace and said to the officials, "That's a fine Elder of
the Nation you have!" The officials, all bowed to him, thanking the holy monk.
"No need for that," said Monkey. "Go and see where your deluded king is."
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1099
"When our monarch saw the fighting he hid in terror," the officials replied. "We do not know which of the
palaces he is in."
"Find him at once," Monkey ordered them. "Perhaps Queen Beauty has carried him off." As soon as the
officials heard this they rushed with Monkey straight to the rooms of Queen Beauty, ignoring the fact that
these were the inner quarters. They were deserted and there was no sign of the king. Queen Beauty was
nowhere to be seen either. The queens of the main, the Eastern and the Western palaces and the consorts of
the six compounds all came to kowtow in thanks to the Great Sage.
"Please get up," Monkey said. "It's too early for thanks now. Go and find your sovereign lord."
A little later four or five eunuchs appeared from behind the Hall of Caution supporting the deluded king. All
the ministers prostrated themselves on the ground and called out in union, "Sovereign lord! Sovereign lord!
We are grateful that this holy monk came here to uncover the impostor. The Elder of the Nation was an evil
spirit and Queen Beauty has vanished too." When the king heard this he invited Monkey to come from the
inner quarters of the palace to the throne hall, where he kowtowed in thanks to Monkey.
"Venerable sir," he said, "when you came to court this morning you were so handsome. Why have you made
yourself look different now?"
"I can tell you for a fact, Your Majesty," replied Monkey with a grin, "that the one who came this morning
was my master Sanzang, the younger brother of the Tang Emperor. I'm his disciple Sun Wukong. There are
two more of us disciples, Zhu Wuneng, or Pig, and Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand, who are both now in the
government hostel. I turned myself into my master's double and came here to defeat the monster because I
knew that you had been deluded by his evil suggestions and were going to take my master's heart to use as an
adjuvant for your elixir."
When the king heard this he ordered his ministers in attendance to go straight to the hostel to fetch Monkey's
master and fellow−disciples. The news that Brother Monkey had turned back into himself and had fought the
evil spirit in mid−air gave Sanzang such a fright that his souls scattered. It was lucky that Pig and Friar Sand
were able to hold him up. His face was still plastered with stinking mud and he was feeling thoroughly
depressed and miserable when he heard someone call, "Master of the Law, we are ministers in attendance sent
by the king of Bhiksuland to invite you to court to receive His Majesty's thanks."
"Don't be afraid, master," said Pig, "don't be afraid. This time he's not sending for you to take your heart out.
I'm sure that elder brother has succeeded and they're inviting you there to thank you."
"Even if they have come to invite me there because he has succeeded I could not face anyone with this
stinking mask on," Sanzang replied.
"We've got no option," said Pig. "We'll just have to go to see my elder brother. He's bound to have a solution."
The venerable elder really did have no choice but to go to the main hall of the hostel with Pig and Friar Sand
carrying the luggage and leading the horse. When the ministers saw him they were all terrified.
"My lord," they said, "they both have heads like monsters."
"Please don't take offence at our ugliness," Friar Sand replied. "Both of us have the bodies that were left after
an earlier life. If my master could see my elder brother he'd become handsome straight away."
When the three of them reached the palace they went straight to the throne hall without waiting to be
summoned. As soon as Monkey saw them he turned round and came down from the hall to meet them. Pulling
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1100
the mud mask off his master's face he blew on him with magic breath, called "Change!" and turned the Tang
Priest back into himself. Sanzang was now in better spirits. The king came down from the throne hall to greet
him as "Master of the Law" and "ancient Buddha." Master and disciples then tethered the horse and went into
the throne hall to be presented.
"Does Your Majesty know where the monsters came from?" Monkey asked. "Let me go and catch them both
for you. Then we will have eliminated future catastrophe."
When all the queens, consorts and concubines of the three palaces and six compounds, who were behind the
screen of bright green jade, heard Monkey saying that he was going to eliminate future catastrophe they cast
aside all their inhibitions about appearing in front of an outsider, and a male one at that, as they came out to
bow to him and say, "We beg you, holy monk and venerable Buddha, to destroy them completely, root and
branch, with your dharma powers. That would be an act of the greatest kindness, and we would of course
reward you richly." Quickly responding to their bows Monkey insisted that the king tell him where the
monsters lived.
"We asked him when he came here three years ago," the king replied shamefacedly, "and he told us that it was
only some twenty miles to the South of the city, in Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Slope. The Elder of the
Nation was old and had no son, only the daughter that his second wife had given him. She was just fifteen and
unmarried. He offered to present her to us, and because we fancied the girl we accepted her. She was the
favorite among all the palace women. We never expected that we would fall so ill that all the prescriptions of
the Royal College of Physicians would be of no avail. Then he told us that he had a formula for an elixir for
which a decoction of boiled little boys' hearts was needed as the adjuvant. In our folly we believed him and
chose some boys from among the common people. At noon today we were going to operate and take out their
hearts. We never expected that you would come down to us, holy monk, and that at that very moment all the
boys would disappear in their coops. Then he said that as you were a holy monk who had cultivated the truth
for ten lifetimes and not yet dissipated your primal masculinity your heart would be ten thousand times more
effective than the little boys' ones. In our temporary delusion we did not realize that you would see through
the evil monster, holy monk. We hope that you will make full use of your great dharma to eliminate any future
catastrophe. All the wealth of the nation will be given to you as your reward."
"I will tell you the truth," Monkey replied. "Because my master took pity on the little boys in the coops he told
me to hide them. Don't say anything about giving us wealth. When I capture the evil monsters that will be a
good deed to my credit. Come with me, Pig."
"Whatever you say, elder brother," Pig replied. "The only thing is that I've got an empty belly: I'll be rather
weak." The king then ordered the department of foreign affairs to prepare a vegetarian meal at once. Before
long the food arrived.
Having eaten his fill, Pig braced his spirits and rose by cloud with Monkey. The king, queens, consorts and
civil and military officials were all so astonished that they all kowtowed to the sky, exclaiming, "They really
are immortals and Buddhas come down to earth." The Great Sage led Pig twenty miles due South, stopped
their wind and cloud and started searching for the demons' home. All he could see was a clear stream running
between banks on which grew thousands of willows: he had no idea where the Pure Splendor Grange might
be. Indeed:
Endless expanses stretched out in his gaze;
The embankment had vanished amid willows and haze.
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1101
When he could not find the grange the Great Sage Sun made a spell with his hands, said the magic word "Om"
and summoned the local deity, who approached shivering and shaking, fell to his knees and called out, "Great
Sage, the local god of Willow Bank kowtows to you."
"Don't be afraid," Monkey said, "I'm not going to hit you. Tell me this: is there a Pure Splendor Grange on
Willow Hill? And where is it?"
"There is a Pure Splendor Cave," the local deity replied, "but there has never been a Pure Splendor Grange. I
suppose you have come from Bhiksuland, Great Sage."
"Yes, yes," Monkey replied. "The king of Bhiksuland was hoodwinked by an evil spirit till I turned up, saw
through the monster, defeated him and drove him away. He turned into a beam of cold light and I don't know
where he went. When I asked the king of Bhiksuland about it he told me that when the demon first presented
him with the girl three years ago he asked the spirit about his background. The demon said that he lived in
Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Hill twenty miles South of the city. I've found this place with its wooded
hill but can't see any Pure Splendor Grange. That's why I asked you about it."
"I beg your forgiveness, Great Sage," said the local god, kowtowing. "This is part of the domain of the king of
Bhiksuland, and I should have kept a closer watch on things. But the evil spirit had such terrible magical
powers. If I had given away what he was doing he would have come and given me a bad time. That is why he
has never been caught. Now that you are here, Great Sage, you need only go to the foot of the nine−forked
willow on the Southern bank, walk round it three times to the left and three times to the right, hit the tree with
both hands and shout 'Open up' three times. The Pure Splendor Cave Palace will then appear."
On learning this the Great Sage sent the local god away again, jumped over the stream with Pig and went to
look for that willow tree. There was indeed a tree with nine forks on a single trunk. "Stand well back,"
Monkey ordered Pig, "while I make the gates open. When I've found the demon and chased him out you're to
help."
In response to this order Pig took up his stand about three hundred yards from the tree while the Great Sage
followed the local god's advice and went round the tree three times to the left and three times to the right then
hit it with both hands, shouting, "Open up! Open up!" An instant later a pair of double doors opened with a
noisy whoosh and the tree was nowhere to be seen. Inside the doors was bright light of many colours but no
sign of human life. Confident in his divine might, Monkey charged in. He could see that it was a fine place:
Shimmering clouds, from which
Sun and moon stole their brightness.
White clouds billowing from the caves,
Bright green lichens running wild in the courtyard.
Along the path rare flowers competed in beauty,
While plants on the steps vied in fragrant blossom.
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1102
Warm was the air
Where it was ever spring.
This was just like a fairyland,
Or Penglai, the paradise of immortals.
Creepers grew all over the benches;
Vines ran wild across the bridge.
Bees flew into the cave carrying flowers;
Butterflies flirted with orchids as they passed the screen of stone.
Hurrying forward for a closer look Monkey saw that on the stone screen was carved IMMORTAL PALACE
OF PURE SPLENDOR. Unable to restrain himself, he jumped over the stone screen to see the old monster
embracing a beautiful woman and telling her breathlessly what had happened in Bhiksuland.
"That was our chance," they said together. "Three years' efforts should have paid off today, but that ape's
ruined everything."
Monkey charged up to them, brandishing his cudgel and shouting, "I'll get you, you fools. What do you mean,
that was your chance? Take that!" Pushing the woman aside, the old monster swung his dragon−headed stick
to block the cudgel. It was a fine battle that the two of them fought in front of the cave, and quite unlike the
previous one:
The upraised cudgel spat out golden light;
Vicious vapors came from the swinging staff.
The monster said,
"How dare you in your ignorance come to my home?"
Monkey replied,
"I intend to subdue evil monsters."
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1103
Said the monster,
"My love for the king was no business of yours,
So why did you come to bully and interfere?"
Answered Monkey,
"A compassionate monk should bring misrule to an end:
We could not endure the slaughter of children."
As they flung words at each other hostility grew:
Staff parried cudgel as blows struck at the heart.
Precious flowers were destroyed as they fought for their lives;
Green moss became slippery when trampled underfoot.
Pale grew the light in the cave as they struggled:
Crushed were the fragrant blooms on the crags.
At the clash of their weapons the birds dared not fly;
Their shouts sent the beauties all running in terror.
Only the monster and Monkey were left
To stir up a hurricane that roared over the earth.
Slowly their battle took them out of the cave
Where Wuneng gave play to his mindless wrath.
The sound of the commotion they were making inside so excited Pig where he was waiting outside that his
heart itched. As he could get no relief from scratching he raised his rake, smashed the nine−forked willow to
the ground, then hit it several times so hard that blood gushed straight out with a barely audible sound. "This
tree's become a spirit," he said, "this tree's a spirit." Pig had just raised his rake for another blow when he saw
Monkey drawing the monster after him. Without another word the idiot rushed forward, raised his rake and
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1104
struck. The old monster was already finding Monkey too much to cope with, so that Pig's rake made him more
desperate than ever. Abandoning the fight he shook himself, turned back into a beam of cold light, and headed
East again. The two of them would not let the demon go but headed Eastwards in pursuit.
Above the shouts of battle they heard the calls of the phoenix and the crane and looked up to see that it was
the Star of Longevity from the Southern pole of the heavens. Placing a cover over the cold light the old man
called out, "Don't be in such a hurry, Great Sage; stop chasing him now, Marshal Tian Peng. This old Taoist
offers his greetings."
Monkey returned his courtesy and asked, "Where have you come from, Longevity my brother?"
"You've capped the cold light, so you must have caught the monster, old fat chops," said Pig with a grin.
"Here he is, here he is," said the Star of Longevity, smiling back. "I trust you two gentlemen will spare his
life."
"The old devil's nothing to do with you, brother," said Monkey, "so why have you come to plead for him?"
"He's a messenger of mine," replied the star with a smile. "I carelessly let him escape to become a monster
here."
"Since he's yours make him turn back into what he really looks like for us to see," said Monkey.
The Star of Longevity then let the cold light out and shouted, "Evil beast! Turn back into yourself at once if
you want to be spared the death penalty." The demon turned himself round and revealed that he was really a
white deer. Picking the staff up the Star of Longevity said, "You've even stolen my staff, evil beast." The deer
lay down in submission, unable to speak, but only kowtowing and weeping. Look at him:
Brindled like a tablet of jade,
And carrying a pair of seven−branched antlers.
When hungry he used to find the herb garden;
On mornings when thirsty he drank from the misty stream.
In his lengthening years he had taught himself to fly
And through many a day had mastered transformation.
Now that he heard the call of his master
He resumed his own form and lay down in the dust.
Thanking Monkey, the Star of Longevity mounted his deer and was just leaving when Monkey grabbed hold
of him and said, "Not so fast, brother. There are a couple more jobs still to be done."
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1105
"What jobs?" the star asked.
"The girl hasn't been caught yet and I don't know what sort of monster she is," Monkey replied. "We've also
got to go back to Bhiksuland together to see the deluded ruler and show him what they really are."
"In that case I'll be patient," the star replied. "You and Marshal Tian Peng can go down into the cave to
capture the girl and take her back to show the king what she really is."
"Just wait a little while," said Monkey. "We'll soon be back."
Pig then summoned up his spirits and went straight into the Immortal Palace of Pure Splendor with Monkey.
"Catch the evil spirit," he shouted, "catch the evil spirit." Hearing this great roar the beauty, who was
trembling with fear and unable to escape, rushed behind the stone screen, but there was no rear exit.
"Where do you think you're going?" Pig shouted. "I'll get you, you man−trap, you whore spirit. Try my rake!"
As the beauty was unarmed she could not fight back, so she dodged the blow and turned herself into a beam of
cold light and fled, only to be stopped by the Great Sage, who with two thumping blows of his cudgel
knocked her off her feet and laid her low in the dust. She turned back into her real form as a white−faced
vixen. Unable to restrain himself, the idiot lifted his rake and struck her a blow on the head. The great beauty
of so many smiles was now a hairy fox.
"Don't smash her to pulp," Monkey said, "keep her in that shape to show her to the deluded king." The idiot
grabbed her by the tail, not minding the filth, and dragged her out through the cave entrance with Monkey.
Here he saw the Star of Longevity stroking the deer's head and giving him a dressing−down.
"Evil beast," he was saying, "why did you run away from me and come here to turn yourself into a spirit? If I
hadn't turned up the Great Sage Sun would certainly have killed you."
"What's that you're saying, brother?" asked Monkey, springing out of the cave.
"I was telling the deer off," the star explained, "telling the deer off."
Throwing the body of the dead fox in front of the deer, Pig said, "Your daughter, I suppose."
The deer nodded then stretched its head out to sniff the body and whimpered as if with grief at its
bereavement until the Star of Longevity cuffed its head and said, "Evil beast. You're lucky to have got away
with your life. What are you sniffing her for?" He then took off the belt he wore round his gown, fastened it
round the deer's neck, and led it off with the words, "Great Sage, let's go to Bhiksuland."
"Wait a moment," said Monkey, "I feel like cleaning the whole place up so that no other evil creatures can
ever live here again."
When Pig heard this he raised his rake and started to smash the willow down wildly. Monkey then said the
magic word "Om" and summoned the local deity once more. "Gather some dried firewood," Monkey ordered
him, "and start a roaring fire that will rid this place of yours of evil. Then you won't be bullied any more."
The local deity then turned around and with a roaring negative wind led his spirit soldiers to gather all sorts of
withered vegetation that had dried out since the previous year: frostbitten grass, autumn grass, knotweed
grass, mountain grass, dragonbone grass, rushes and reeds. Once set alight they would burn like oil or grease.
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1106
"There's no need to go knocking trees over, Pig," said Monkey. "Fill the mouth of the cave with all this and
set it alight: that'll burn the place clean out." And indeed once they were lit they turned the evil demons' Pure
Splendor home into a fiery furnace. Only then did Monkey dismiss the local god and go with the Star of
Longevity as they dragged the fox to the steps of the throne hall where he said to the king, "Here's your Queen
Beauty. Do you want to fool around with her now?"
This caused the king a terrible shock. At the sight of the Great Sage Monkey bringing the Star of Longevity
with the white deer before the throne hall, monarch, ministers, consorts and queens all dropped to the ground
to kowtow. Monkey went up to the king and held him up. "Don't kowtow to me," he said with a smile. "This
deer is the Elder of the Nation. It's him you should be kowtowing to."
The king was now so overcome with shame that he could only say, "Thank you, holy monk, for saving the
boys in my kingdom. It truly was an act of heavenly kindness." He then ordered the department of foreign
relations to prepare a vegetarian feast, had the Eastern hall of the palace opened up and invited the star, the
Ancient of the Southern Pole, to take part in a thanksgiving feast with the Tang Priest and his three disciples.
Sanzang bowed in greeting to the Star of Longevity, as did Friar Sand.
"If the white deer is one of your creatures, Star of Longevity," they both asked, "how did he get here to
become such a nuisance?"
"Some time ago the Lord of Eastern Splendor came to my mountain," the Star of Longevity replied with a
smile, "and I persuaded him to sit down for some chess. The wicked creature escaped before our first game
was over. It was only when I couldn't find him after my visitor had gone that I worked out by calculating on
my fingers that he must have come here. I had just reached here in my search for him when I met the Great
Sage Sun using his mighty powers. If I had been any later this beast would be dead." Before he could finish
his remarks it was announced that the banquet was ready. It was a splendid vegetarian feast:
The room was overflowing with color;
Exotic fragrances filled the hall.
Embroidered hangings made the tables magnificent;
Red carpets on the floor shimmered like the glow of dawn.
From duck−shaped censers
Curled the scented smoke of eaglewood;
Before the king's place
Were fragrant vegetables.
See how high the towers of fruit were piled;
Sugar dragons and prowling animals.
Molded mandarin ducks,
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1107
Lion confections,
Looking quite lifelike.
Parrot goblets,
Cormorant ladles,
Shaped like the real thing.
Every kind of fruit in abundance,
Each exquisite dish a delicacy.
Giant longans and tender bamboo−shoots,
Fresh lichees and peaches.
Sweet smelled the jujubes and persimmon cakes;
More fragrant than wine were the pine−nuts and grapes.
Many a sweet dish made with honey,
Steamed pastries of various kinds,
Sugar−drenched doughnuts
Piled up like bouquets of flowers,
Mountains of rolls on golden dishes,
Fragrant rice heaped high in silver bowls,
Long bean noodles in hot chili soup,
Tasty dishes came in succession.
There was no end of button mushrooms,
"Tree−ear" fungus,
Tender bamboo shoots,
Sealwort,
Vegetables of many flavors,
A hundred kinds of rare delights.
They came and went in endless succession,
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1108
All the abundant dishes offered at the feast.
The seating was arranged on the spot, the seat of honour going to the Star of Longevity and the next best place
to the Tang Priest. The king sat between them while Brother Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand sat at the side
places. There were also three senior ministers present to keep them company, and the musicians and singers of
the court theatre were ordered to perform. Holding his purple cloud goblet, the king, toasted them one by one.
The only person who would not drink was the Tang Priest. "Brother," said Pig to Monkey, "I'll leave the fruit
for you, but you must let me have a good feed of the soup, bread and rice." With no further thought the idiot
ate everything all at once. He devoured everything that was brought in and left nothing behind.
When the banquet was coming to an end the Star of Longevity took his leave of them. The king went up to
him, knelt, kowtowed and begged the star to tell him the secret of eliminating disease and prolonging life. "I
didn't bring any elixir as I was here to search for my deer," the Star of Longevity replied. "I would like to
teach you the techniques of self−cultivation, but you are so weak in body and ruined in spirit that you would
not be able to convert the elixir. All I have in my sleeve is these three jujubes that I was intending to offer to
the Lord of Eastern Splendor to take with tea. As they haven't been eaten I can offer them to you now."
The king swallowed them, and he gradually began to feel lighter in body as the illness was cured. This was the
origin of his later success in achieving immortality. As soon as Pig saw this he called, "Longevity, old pal, if
you've got any fire jujubes give me some."
"I didn't bring any," the star replied, "but I'll give you several pounds of them next time." The Star of
Longevity then went out of the Eastern pavilion, expressed his thanks, called to the white deer, sprang on his
back and departed by cloud. We will not relate how the king, queens and consorts in the palace and the
common people in the city all burnt incense and kowtowed.
"Disciples," said Sanzang, "let us pack up and take our leave of His Majesty." The king pleaded with them to
stay and instruct him. "Your Majesty," said Monkey, "from now on you should be less greedy for your sexual
pleasures and accumulate more hidden merit. In whatever you do you should use your strong points to make
up for your weaknesses. This is the way to get rid of your illness and prolong your life. That's what we'll tell
you." Two dishes full of small pieces of gold and silver were then offered to the pilgrims to help with the
expenses of their journey, but the Tang Priest refused to accept a single penny. The king then had no choice
but to order the royal carriage and invite the Tang Priest to sit in the dragon and phoenix coach while he, his
queens and his consorts pushed the wheels. Thus they escorted him out of the palace. In the streets and
markets the common people also came with bowls of pure water and incense−burners to see them on their
way from the city.
Suddenly there was the sound of a wind in the sky and 1,111 goose coops landed on both sides of the road.
The little boys in them were crying. Unseen in the sky were the deities who had been looking after them: the
city and the local gods, the deities of the altars, the True Officials, the Guardians of the Four Quarters and the
Centre, the Four Duty Gods, the Six Dings and Six Jias, the Protectors of the Faith and the rest of them, who
all responded with a loud shout of, "Great Sage, on your earlier instructions we carried the boys away in the
goose coops. Now that we have learned of your success in your task and your departure we have brought
every one of them back again." The king, his queens and consorts and all his ministers and subjects fell to
their knees to kowtow.
Journey to the West
Chapter 79 1109
"Thank you for your efforts, gentlemen," Monkey shouted to the sky. "Please all return to your shrines now.
I'll get the people to make thanksgiving offerings to you." With a soughing noise the magic wind then arose
again and departed.
Monkey then told the people of the city to come and collect their children. The news was spread at once, and
the people all came to claim the boys in the baskets. They were very happy indeed. Holding the boys in their
arms they called them dear ones and darlings. Dancing and laughing they told their children to take hold of the
lords from Tang and bring them home so that they could express their thanks for the boys' rescue. Nobody,
young or old, male or female, was frightened by the disciples' ugly faces as they all carried Pig, Friar Sand,
Monkey and the Tang Priest back to the city in the middle of a crowd that also brought their luggage and led
the horse. The king could not stop them. Family after family laid on a banquet or a feast, and those who could
not offer hospitality made monkish hats, shoes, tunics, cotton socks, and other inner and outer garments in
different sizes that they presented to the pilgrims. Only when they had been entertained in this way for nearly
a month were the travelers able to leave the city. Portraits of them were painted and tablets bearing their
names set up; to these the people could kowtow, burn incense and make offerings. Indeed:
Great was the gratitude for their enormous kindness,
In saving the lives of infants by the thousand.
If you don't know what happened later listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 80
The Young Girl Seeks a Mate to Build Up the Male
Protecting His Master the Mind−Ape Sees Through a Demon
The story tells how the king, ministers and common people of Bhiksuland escorted the Tang Priest and his
three disciples out of the city. Seven miles later they were still unwilling to part from the pilgrims, but
Sanzang insisted on getting out of the coach, mounting the horse and taking his leave of them. The people
who had been seeing him off did not return to the city until the travelers had vanished from view.
When the four had been travelling for a long time the winter and the spring too were over. There was no end
of wild flowers and mountain trees to be seen; fragrant blossoms filled the view. To Sanzang's alarm another
towering mountain appeared in front of them.
"Disciples," he asked, "is there a way across the high mountain before us? We must be careful."
"Master," laughed Brother Monkey, "that's not what a seasoned traveler should be saying. You sound much
more like some pampered prince trying to look at the whole sky from the bottom of a well. As the old saying
goes, a mountain can't stop the road: it can find its own way across. So why ask whether there's a way?"
"Even if this mountain cannot block the road," Sanzang replied, "I am afraid that there may be monsters on
the mountain precipices and evil spirits that will emerge from its deep recesses."
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1110
"Don't worry," said Pig, "don't worry. We're not far from Paradise here. I guarantee it'll all be nice and
peaceful−−there won't be any trouble." As they were talking master and disciples reached the foot of the
mountain without even noticing. Taking out his gold−banded cudgel Monkey climbed the rock−face.
"Master," he called, "there's a path that goes round the mountain. The going's very easy. Hurry up!" The Tang
Priest now put his worries aside and whipped the horse forward. "Carry the luggage for a while, brother," said
Friar Sand to Pig, who did so while Friar Sand held the horse's reins and the master sat in the carved saddle.
They hurried along the main path up the steep slope after Monkey. This was what the mountain looked like:
The peak was wrapped in clouds;
Torrents rushed down ravines.
The paths were heavy with the scent of flowers,
And dense grew the countless trees.
Blue were the gages, white the plums,
Green the willows and red the peaches.
Spring was all but over where the cuckoo sang;
When fledgling swallows chirped the festival was finished.
Craggy boulders,
Blue−green pines shaped like parasols.
The track leading across the ridge
Climbed high over a tracery of rocks;
The beetling precipice
Was overgrown with creepers, grass and trees.
Peaks like a row of halberds vied in elegance;
Far from the ocean wave streams competed in gullies.
As the master was taking an unhurried look at the mountain scenery he was moved to homesickness by the
sound of a bird singing. "Disciples," he said,
"After receiving His Majesty's command
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1111
I was given my passport in front of the brocade screen.
Watching lanterns on the fifteenth night I left the Eastern land,
And then was parted from the emperor of Tang.
Just when the dragon and tiger winds both met
I and my disciples had to struggle with the horse.
Twelve may be the peaks of Mount Wu;
But when shall I face and see you again?"'
"Master," said Monkey, "you're always suffering from homesickness. You're not like a monk at all. Stop
worrying and keep going: don't upset yourself so. As the old saying goes, you've got to work hard if you want
to be rich and successful."
"What you say is quite right, disciple," said Sanzang, "but I do not know where the road to the West runs."
"Master," said Pig, "it's all because our Tathagata Buddha can't bring himself to give those scriptures away.
He must have removed the path because he knows we're coming to fetch them. Why else can't we get to the
end of the journey?"
"Don't talk such nonsense," said Friar Sand. "Just keep going with big brother. As long as we stick with him
we're bound to get there in the end."
As they were talking master and disciples came in sight of a great expanse of dark pine forest. In his fear the
Tang Priest called out, "Wukong, no sooner have we taken that precipitous track over the mountain than we
come to this deep, dark pine forest. Why? We must be careful."
"There's nothing to be scared of," said Monkey.
"Nonsense," said Sanzang. "Never trust what appears to be absolutely upright, and be on your guard against
evil masquerading as goodness. I have been through quite a few pine woods with you, but never one as vast
and deep as this. Just look at the trees:
Dense−packed to East and West,
In lines to North and South.
Dense−packed to East and West they reach the end of the clouds;
In lines to North and South they touch the azure firmament.
Thorns and brambles grow close−tangled all about;
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1112
Knotweed wraps itself around the branches.
Liana coils round kudzu vine,
Kudzu coils around liana.
Where liana coils around kudzu
Travelers cannot move between East and West;
Where kudzu coils round liana
Merchants may not ply between North and South.
In this forest
You could spend half a year,
Not knowing whether sun or moon was out,
Or travel for miles
And never see the stars.
Where the outlook is to the North the view is unbounded;
On Southern slopes the bushes are in flower.
There are thousand−year−old locust trees,
Ten−thousand−year−old junipers,
Pines that endure the winter cold,
Mountain peaches that bear fruit,
Wild peonies,
And hibiscus,
All growing in a close−packed profusion,
So wild that not even a god could paint it.
Bird−song could be heard:
Parrots shrieking,
Cuckoos calling,
Magpies in the branches,
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1113
Crows feeding their mothers,
Orioles with their aerial dance,
As the mynas adjust their voices.
Quails singing,
Swallows chirping,
Mynas imitating people,
And thrushes that could recite sutras.
Then there were:
Great beasts swishing their tails,
Tigers gnashing their teeth.
Aged foxes and raccoon−dogs disguised as ladies,
Ancient gray wolves at whose baying the forest shook.
Had the Pagoda−carrying Heavenly King come here
His power to suppress demons would have been of no avail.
The Great Sage Sun was unafraid. Clearing the way ahead with his cudgel, he led the Tang Priest into the
depths of the forest.
They had been travelling in this carefree style for many hours without seeing any sign of a way out of the
forest when the Tang Priest called out, "Disciples, we have been through no end of steep and dangerous
mountain woods on our journey West. Thank goodness we have found this purity and elegance and a smooth
path. The rare and unusual flowers here are truly delightful. I intend to sit here for a moment to let the horse
have a rest. I am, besides, famished. Go and beg me some meat−free food from somewhere."
"Master," said Monkey, "please dismount while I go begging." This the venerable elder did. While Pig tied the
horse to a tree Friar Sand put the luggage down, brought out the begging−bowl and handed it to Monkey.
"Sit still here, Master," Monkey said, "and don't even say the word 'fear'. I'll be back in a moment." While
Sanzang sat upright in the shade of the pines Pig and Friar Sand amused themselves looking for flowers and
fruit.
Let us tell of the Great Sage who somersaulted into mid air, brought his cloud to a hall and looked back. All
he could see coming from the pine forest were auspicious clouds and auras that coiled and spread all around.
"Good, good," he found himself saying. Do you know why? He was expressing his admiration for the Tang
Priest, the reincarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada and a holy man who had cultivated his conduct for
ten successive lifetimes, which explained there was such an aura of good omen above his head.
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1114
"Five hundred years ago, when I made havoc in heaven," Monkey thought, "I wandered to the very corners of
the oceans and ran wild at the end of the sky. I led a host of spirits and called myself the Great Sage Equaling
Heaven. We subdued dragons and tigers, and I took us off the registers of death. I used to wear a triple golden
crown and a coat of golden mail, and with my gold−banded cudgel in my hands and my cloud−treading shoes
on my feet I had 47,000 demons under me. They all used to call me Lord Great Sage. I really was someone in
those days. But ever since being rescued from Heaven's punishment I've been a small−time nobody as his
disciple. I reckon that as the master has such an aura of auspicious clouds over his head things are sure to turn
out well for us on our way back to the East and I'm bound to win the true achievement."
As Brother Monkey was congratulating himself along these lines he saw a column of black vapor rising from
the South of the forest. "That black vapor means evil for sure," he thought with alarm. "No black vapors could
come from our Pig or Friar Sand."
While the Great Sage was still trying to make out exactly what the vapors were coming from, Sanzang was
sitting in the forest clarifying his mind and contemplating the Buddha−nature as he recited the
Mahaprajnaparamita Heart Sutra when suddenly he heard a high−pitched cry of "Help!"
"This is all very well," said Sanzang with astonishment, "but who could that be calling so deep in the forest?"
It must be someone terrified by a wolf, a tiger, a leopard or some other wild beast. I shall go to take a look."
The venerable elder rose to his feet and walked through the thousand−year−old cypresses and even more
ancient pines, holding on to vines and creepers, as he went close enough to see a woman tied to a big tree. The
top half of her body was bound to the trunk with creepers and her lower half buried in the ground. Sanzang
stopped to ask, "Why are you tied up here, lady Bodhisattva?"
It was quite obvious that the wretched creature was an evil monster, but with his mortal eyes in a worldling's
body Sanzang was unable to perceive this. The monster's response to the question was to weep copiously. Just
look at the tears rolling down her peachy cheeks. She was so lovely that fish would have sunk and wild geese
fallen out of the sky at the sight of her; the beauty of her sorrowing and sparkling eyes would have made the
moon hide away and put the flowers to shame. Sanzang did not dare go any closer to her as he opened his
mouth to ask, "What crime have you committed, lady Bodhisattva? Tell me so that I can rescue you."
The evil spirit then quickly put together a pack of lies as she replied, "Master, my home is in the country of
Pinpo, which is some seventy miles from here. Both my parents are at home, and they are very great lovers of
goodness. All their lives they have been on good terms with their relations and devoted to their friends. At the
Clear and Bright Festival they invited all their relations and members of their own family to pay their respects
at and sweep the ancestral graves. A whole procession of carrying−chairs and horses all went to the graves in
the wilds outside the city. Here we set out our offerings and had just burnt the paper models of horses when a
band of brigands sprang upon us with the sound of gongs and drums. They charged us shouting 'kill!' My
parents and relations all got hold of horses and carrying−chairs and fled for their lives. Because I am so young
I was too frightened to run: I just collapsed and was carried back to the mountains by the brigands. The top
chieftain wanted me for his lady, the number two chieftain wanted me for his woman, and the third and fourth
ones both fancied me for my looks. There were seventy or eighty of them all quarrelling over me and none of
them would give way. So they tied me up here in the forest and broke up the band. I've been here for five days
and five nights now and I'm only just alive now. I'll soon be dead. Goodness only knows which ancestor
however many generations back accumulated the virtue that brought you here to me today, reverend sir. I beg
you in your great mercy to save my life. I won't forget your goodness to me even when I lie dead under the
nine springs of the underworld." When she had finished speaking her tears flowed like rain.
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1115
As Sanzang really did have a merciful heart he could not help weeping and sobbing himself. "Disciples," he
shouted. Pig and Friar Sand were still looking for flowers and fruit in the forest when suddenly they heard
their master's anguished cry.
"Friar Sand," said the idiot, "the master's found a relation here."
"What nonsense, brother," said Friar Sand with a smile. "In all the time we've been going we haven't met a
single good person, so where could any relation of his have come from?"
"If it's not a relation why's the master crying for them?" Pig asked, adding, "You and I had better go to take a
look." Friar Sand did indeed go back to where they had been before. Leading the horse and carrying the
luggage they went up to the master and asked, "What's up, Master?"
The Tang Priest pointed at the tree as he replied, "Pig, untie this lady Bodhisattva and save her life." Without
caring whether this was the right or the wrong thing to do, the idiot set to.
The Great Sage meanwhile saw from up in the air the dense black vapors completely obscuring the auspicious
glow. "This is bad," he said, "this is bad. If the black vapors are covering the auspicious glow that means
something evil is threatening my master. Never mind about begging for food−−I'm going back to see the
master." He turned his cloud back and landed in the forest, where he saw Pig recklessly untying the ropes.
Going up to him Monkey grabbed an ear and threw him to the ground. "The master told me to rescue her," the
idiot protested, looking up to see Monkey as he scrambled back to his feet, "so why did you push me over like
that? You're just throwing your weight about."
"Brother," replied Monkey with a smile, "don't untie her. She's an evil spirit who's been putting on an act to
fool us."
"Wretched ape," shouted Sanzang, "talking nonsense again. How can you possibly take a girl like this for an
evil spirit?"
"There's something you don't know, Master." Monkey replied. "In the old days I tried all these tricks myself
when I wanted some human flesh. You couldn't possibly tell what she is."
"Master," said Pig, pouting sulkily, "don't let that Protector of the Horses take you in. She's a local girl. We've
never had dealings with her before on our long journey from the East and she's no relation or in−law of ours,
so how can you say she's an evil spirit? He's trying to get rid of us by making us go ahead so he can turn a
somersault and get back here by magic. Then he's going to have a bit of fun with her and ruin our reputation."
"You cretin," shouted Brother Monkey, "stop talking such rubbish. I've never done any such outrageous thing
on all our journey to the West. I reckon it must have been some reckless womanizer like yourself who forgot
his principles when he saw a good chance. I expect you tricked some family into taking you as their
son−in−law and tied her up here."
"That's enough of that," said Sanzang, "that's enough. Now then, Bajie. Your elder brother usually sees things
very clearly. Ignore what he is saying. Let us be on our way."
"Splendid," said Monkey with great delight, "you have a good destiny, Master. Please mount. Once we're out
of the pine forest there will be a house where we can beg for some food for you." The four of them then
pressed on together, leaving the monster behind.
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1116
The story tells how the monster gnashed her teeth with fury as she was left tied there to the tree. "I've heard
tell of Sun Wukong's tremendous magic powers for years," she said, "and now that I've seen him today I know
that his reputation's well−founded. As that Tang Priest has been cultivating his conduct ever since he was a
boy he has never lost a drop of his primal masculinity. I was longing to mate with him so that I could become
a golden immortal of the Supreme Ultimate. I never expected that monkey to see through my magic and save
him. If I'd been untied and released I could have carried him off whenever I chose and he'd have been mine.
Now that Sun Wukong has made those damaging remarks and taken the Tang Priest away my efforts have all
been for nothing. Let's see what happens when I give him another couple of shouts."
Not shifting her ropes, the evil spirit made the most of the wind being in the right direction to carry some
high−pitched words of morality into the Tang Priest's ear. Do you know what she was shouting? "Master," she
called, "if you forget your conscience and refuse to save a living being's life what's the use of your fetching
the scriptures from the Buddha?"
When the Tang Priest heard this call he reined the horse in and said, "Wukong, go and rescue that girl."
"You've started on your way, Master," Monkey replied. "What made you think of her again?"
"She is shouting again there," the Tang Priest said.
"Did you hear, Pig?" Monkey asked.
"My big lugs cover my ear−holes," Pig replied, "and I didn't hear anything."
"Did you hear, Friar Sand?"
"I was walking ahead, carrying the pole with the luggage," Friar Sand replied. "I wasn't paying attention and I
didn't hear anything either."
"Neither did I," said Monkey. "What did she say, Master? You were the only one who heard."
"What she called was quite right," the Tang Priest called. "She asked what was the use of fetching scriptures
when I went to visit the Buddha if I forgot my conscience and refused to save a living being's life. To save a
human life is better than building a seven−storied pagoda. Rescuing her straight away would be even better
than worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures."
"If you're wanting to be charitable, Master," Monkey replied, "you're incurable. Just think of all the demons
you've met in all the mountains you've crossed on your journey West since leaving the East. They've often
taken you into their caves and I've had to rescue you. I've killed tens of thousands of them with this iron
cudgel of mine. So why can't you bring yourself to let a single devil die today? Why do you have to rescue
her?"
"Disciple," the Tang Priest replied, "there's an old saying, 'Do not fail to do a good deed because it is small; do
not commit a bad deed because it is small.' You're still to go and save her."
"If that's the way you're going to be, Master, I can't accept that responsibility," Monkey replied. "You insist on
rescuing her and I dare not try too hard to dissuade you. When I did make a little attempt to do so you lost
your temper again. You can go and rescue her if you want to."
"Watch your tongue, ape," Sanzang retorted. "Sit here while Bajie and I go to rescue her."
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1117
The Tang Priest went back into the forest and told Pig to undo the ropes around the top half of her body and
dig the lower half out with his rake. The demon stamped her feet, fastened her skirt and happily followed the
Tang Priest out of the pine forest. When she met Monkey all he did was to wear a mocking smile.
"Impudent ape," said the Tang Priest abusively, "what are you smiling at?"
"I'm laughing at you," Monkey replied:
"You meet up with good friends when your luck is going well;
And when it's going badly you find yourself a belle."
"Impudent macaque!" said Sanzang, being abusive again. "What nonsense! I have been a monk ever since I
came out of my mother's womb. I am now making this journey West at His Majesty's command with the
devout intention of worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures. I am not the sort of person to care
about wealth and office, so what do you mean by my luck going badly?"
"Master," replied Monkey with a grin, "you may have been a monk since you were a child, and you may be
good at reading sutras and invoking the Buddha, but you have never studied the text of royal laws. This girl is
young and beautiful. If monks like us travel with her we may well meet with evil people who arrest us and
turn us in to the authorities. They won't care about worshipping Buddhas or fetching scriptures. They'll treat it
as a case of illicit sex, and even if that isn't proved we'll still be convicted of abduction. You will lose your
ordination license, Master, and be beaten half to death. Pig will be sent into exile and Friar Sand sentenced to
penal servitude. Even I won't get off scot−free. No matter how I try to talk my way out of it I'll still be found
guilty of wrongdoing."
"Don't talk such rubbish," Sanzang shouted. "After all, I did save her life. There will be no trouble. We are
taking her with us. I will be responsible for whatever happens."
"You may say you'll be responsible, Master," Monkey replied, "but what you don't realize is that so far from
rescuing her you're destroying her."
"I saved her life by rescuing her from the forest," said Sanzang, "so how can I be destroying her?"
"If she had stayed tied up in the forest without any food for three to five days, ten days or even half a month
and starved to death," said Monkey, "she would at least have gone to the Underworld with her body in one
piece. But now you've taken her away from there. You're on a fast horse and travelling like the wind. The rest
of us have to follow you. How will she be able to keep up on her tiny feet? She can barely walk. If she gets
left behind and a wolf, a tiger or a leopard eats her up you'll have killed her."
"You are right," Sanzang said. "Thank you for thinking of it. What are we to do about it?"
"Lift her up and let her ride on the horse with you," replied Monkey with a grin.
"I could not possibly ride on the same horse as her," moaned Sanzang.
"Then how is she to travel?" Monkey asked. "Bajie can carry her on his back," Sanzang replied.
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1118
"You're in luck, idiot," said Monkey.
"There's no such thing as a light load on a long journey," Pig replied. "Having to carry her isn't luck."
"With your long snout you'll be able to turn it round and chat her up on the quiet while you're carrying her,"
Monkey replied, "which will be very convenient for you."
Pig's reaction to hearing this was to beat his chest and jump about in fury. "That's terrible," he said, "that's
terrible, I'd sooner put up with the pain of a flogging from the master. If I carry her I won't possibly come out
of it clean. You've always been a slanderer. I'm not carrying her."
"Very well then," Sanzang said, "very well then. I can walk a little further. I shall come down and walk slowly
with you. Bajie can lead the horse with nobody riding it."
"You've got yourself a good bargain there, idiot," said Monkey, roaring with laughter. "The master's done you
a favour by letting you lead the horse."
"You are talking nonsense again, ape," said Sanzang. "As the ancients said, 'When a horse is to travel three
hundred miles it cannot get there by itself.' If I walk slowly are you going to leave me behind? When I go
slowly you will have to go slowly too. We shall all take the lady Bodhisattva down the mountain together. We
can leave her in some convent, temple, monastery or house that we come to. Then we will still have rescued
her."
"You're right, Master," Monkey replied. "Let's press on quickly."
Sanzang took the lead while Friar Sand carried the luggage, Pig led the riderless horse and the girl, and
Monkey carried his iron cudgel as they carried on together. Within seven to ten miles the evening was
drawing in and a tall building came into sight.
"Disciple," said Sanzang, "that must be a temple of some sort. We shall ask to spend the night here and be on
our way first thing tomorrow."
"What you say is right, Master," said Monkey. "Let's all get a move on."
They were soon at the gates, where Sanzang told them, "Keep well out of the way while I go in first to ask if
we can stay for the night. If it looks suitable I shall send someone to call to you." So they all stood in the
shadows of the poplars while Monkey kept an eye on the girl, his iron cudgel in his hand.
The venerable elder walked forward to see that the gates were hanging crooked and falling to pieces. What he
saw when he pushed the gates open chilled him to the heart:
The cloisters were deserted,
The ancient shrine left desolate.
The courtyard was overgrown with moss;
Sagebrush and brambles choked the paths.
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1119
The only lanterns came from the fireflies
While the croaking of frogs had replaced the water−clock.
The venerable elder started crying. Indeed:
The desolate halls were falling down,
The lonely cloisters collapsing.
Broken bricks and tiles lay in a dozen heaps,
And all the pillars and beams were askew.
Grass was growing all around;
The kitchens were crumbling and buried in dust.
In derelict towers the drums had lost their skins;
Broken was the glass lamp.
The color had gone from the Buddha's golden statue;
The figures of arhats lay strewn upon the floor.
Guanyin had turned to mud in the soaking rain,
Her pure vase with a willow spray fallen to the ground.
No monk was to be seen there by day,
And only foxes slept there at night.
As the wind roared with the sound of thunder
This was a place for tiger and leopard to shelter.
The walls around had collapsed
And no gates could be closed to guard it.
There is a poem about this that goes
For many a year had the temple been unrepaired;
In its derelict state it had gone from bad to worse.
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1120
The gales had destroyed the faces of the temple guardians,
And rainstorms had washed the heads off the Buddha statues.
The vajrapani had collapsed and been soaked through.
The local god had lost his shrine and stayed outside at night.
Two other things were even more depressing:
Bell and drums lay on the ground instead of hanging in their towers.
Summoning up his courage, Sanzang went in through the inner gates where he saw that the bell−tower and
drum−tower had both collapsed, leaving only a single bronze bell planted in the ground, its bottom half the
color of indigo. With the passage of the years the top half of the bell had been bleached in the rain while the
earth's vapors had greened the lower part.
"Bell," Sanzang called aloud as he touched it,
"Once you roared from high in the tower,
Calling afar from the painted beam where you hung.
At cockcrow you used to ring in the dawn,
And at evening you announced the dusk.
Where now are the lay brothers who begged for the copper,
Or the craftsman who cast it to form you?
Both, I imagine, are now in the Underworld;
They have gone without trace and you are left silent."
The venerable elder's loud sighs had by now disturbed someone in the monastery. A lay brother who was
offering incense heard the voice, climbed to his feet, picked up a broken brick and threw it at the bell. The
bell's clang gave the venerable elder such a fright that he fell over then scrambled up again to flee, only to trip
over the root of a tree and go flying again.
As he lay on the ground Sanzang raised his head and said, "Bell,
I was just lamenting your fate
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1121
When suddenly you clanged.
On this deserted route to the West
Over the years you have turned into a spirit."
The lay brother came over to Sanzang and steadied him as he said, "Please get up, reverend sir. The bell hasn't
become a spirit. It was I who struck it just now." Looking up and seeing how dark and ugly the other was
Sanzang said, "I suppose you are a goblin or some other evil creature. I am no ordinary man. I come from
Great Tang and I have disciples who can subdue dragons and tigers. If you run into them your life will be
lost."
"Don't be afraid, my lord," replied the lay brother, falling to his knees. I'm no evil being. I'm a lay brother who
looks after the incense here. When I heard those fine things you were saying just now I wanted to come out
and welcome you but I was afraid that it might be some demon knocking at the gates. That was why I didn't
dare come out until I'd thrown a piece of brick at the bell to calm my fears. Please rise, my lord."
Only then did Sanzang calm himself sufficiently to reply, "Lay brother, that fright was almost the death of me.
Take me inside." The lay brother led Sanzang straight in through the third pair of gates. What the Tang Priest
saw here was quite different from outside:
A cloud−patterned wall built of blue bricks,
Halls roofed with green glazed tiles.
The holy statues were sheathed in gold,
The steps made of pure white jade.
Blue light danced in the Buddha hall;
Fine vapors rose from the Vairocana chapel.
Above the Manjusri hall
Were decorations of flying clouds;
In the Library of Scriptures
Were patterns of flowers and green leaves.
On the roof above the triple eaves stood a precious jar;
In the Tower of Five Blessings embroidered covers were spread.
A thousand bright bamboos waved over the dhyana seat;
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1122
Ten thousand bluish pines threw their light on the gates.
Jade−coloured clouds reflected gold on this palace;
Auspicious clouds drifted round the woods full of purple mist.
Each morning the fragrant breezes could be smelled all around;
In the evening painted drums were heard on the high hills.
There should be morning sunshine to patch torn robes;
How can the sutra be finished by the light of the moon?
The courtyard at the back is lit by half a wall of lamps;
A column of fragrant smoke shines in the hall.
Sanzang saw this but did not dare go inside. "Lay brother," he called, "why is the front of the monastery so
dilapidated but the back so neat and tidy?"
"My lord," said the lay brother with a smile, "these mountains are full of evil creatures and brigands. On clear
days they roam the mountains to rob and on dull ones they shelter in the monastery. They knock the Buddha
statues down to use as seats and burn the wooden pillars for firewood. The monks here are too feeble to argue
with them, which is why they have abandoned the wrecked buildings at the front for the brigands to stay in.
They have found some new benefactors to build the new monastery for them. Now there is one for the pure
and one for the impure. This is how we do things in the West."
"So that is the way things are," said Sanzang.
As he walked further Sanzang saw written over the gate in large letters SEA−GUARDING MONASTERY
OF MEDITATION. Only then did he stride in through the gates, where a monk appeared coming towards
him. Just see what the monk looked like:
His hat of velvet and brocade was held with a pin,
And a pair of bronze rings hung from his ears.
His tunic was made of woolen stuff,
And his eyes were white and bright as silver.
He held in his hand a self−beating drum
As he recited scriptures in an unknown tongue.
Sanzang did not know before
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1123
That he was a lama on the road to the West.
As the lama came out he saw how very handsome and elegant Sanzang was: clear−browed and fine−eyed with
a broad forehead and level top to his skull, ears hanging to his shoulders and arms so long they came below
his knees. He looked like an arhat come down to earth. The lama, his face wreathed in smiles, went up to
Sanzang chuckling with delight to grab hold of him, feel his hands and feet, rub his nose and tug at his ears as
ways of showing his friendliness.
After leading Sanzang into the abbot's lodgings and going through the rituals of greeting the lama asked him,
"Where have you come from, venerable Father?"
"I have been sent by His Majesty the Emperor of Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the
scriptures from Thunder Monastery in India in the West," Sanzang replied. "As we were passing this way
when it was becoming dark I have come to your distinguished monastery to put up here for the night before
leaving early tomorrow morning. I beg you to grant me this expeditious help."
"You shouldn't say that," replied the lama with a smile, "you shouldn't say that. We didn't really want to
become monks. We were all given life by our mothers and fathers and only cut our ties with them because we
had unlucky destinies and our families could not afford to keep us. Even though we are now disciples of the
Buddhist faith you must not talk empty words."
"I spoke in all sincerity," Sanzang replied.
"However far is the journey from the East to the Western Heaven?" the monk said. "Along the way there are
mountains, there are caves in the mountains and there are spirits in the caves. I don't think that a lone traveler
looking as delicate as you could possibly be a pilgrim going to fetch the scriptures."
"You are quite right, abbot," Sanzang replied. "I could never have got here alone. I have three disciples who
clear my way across the mountains and build me bridges over rivers. It is only because they have protected me
that I have been able to reach your monastery."
"Where are your three distinguished disciples?" the lama asked.
"Waiting outside the gates of the monastery," Sanzang replied.
"Father," said the lama with alarm, "you don't realize that there are dangerous tigers, wolves, evil bandits,
ghosts and demons here. We don't dare roam far even by day and we shut the gates before nightfall. How can
you leave people outside this late?" He then told his disciples to ask them in at once.
Two young lamas hurried outside. At the sight of Monkey they fell over, and then fell over again when they
saw Pig. Scrambling to their feet they ran back in as fast as they could and said, "My lord, your luck is out.
Your disciples have disappeared. There are only three or four evil monsters standing outside the gates."
"What do they look like?" Sanzang asked.
"One has a face like a thunder god," the young lamas replied, "one has a face like a tilt−hammer, and one has
a green face and terrible fangs. There is a girl with them too−−she has oiled hair and a powdered face."
Journey to the West
Chapter 80 1124
"You would not know who they are," replied Sanzang with a smile. "The three ugly ones are my disciples and
the girl is someone I rescued in the pine forest."
"My lord," the lama said, "how can a master as handsome as you have found yourself such ugly disciples?"
"Ugly they may be," Sanzang replied, "but they are all useful. Ask them in straight away. If you take any
longer the one who looks like a thunder god is a bit of a trouble−maker. He was not born to a mother and
father and he will fight his way in."
The young lamas then hurried outside again and fell to their knees, shivering and shaking, as they said, "My
lords, Lord Tang invites you in."
"Brother," said Pig, "if he's invited us, that's that. Why are they shivering and shaking?"
"They're scared because we're so ugly," Monkey replied.
"Rubbish," said Pig. "We were born that way. None of us is ugly from choice."
"Make yourself look a bit less ugly," said Monkey, and the idiot really did tuck his snout into his tunic and
keep his head down as he led the horse while Friar Sand carried the pole and Brother Monkey brought up the
rear, holding his cudgel in his hand and dragging the girl along. They went past the ruined buildings and
cloisters and in through the third part of gates. When they had tethered the horse they went into the abbot's
lodgings to meet the lama and take their seats in order of precedence. The lama then went inside to lead
seventy or eighty young lamas to greet them, tidy their rooms, give them a vegetarian meal and look after
them. Indeed:
In storing up achievement be mindful of mercy;
When the Buddha's Dharma flourishes monks admire each other.
If you do not know how they left the monastery, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 81
The Mind−Ape Recognizes a Monster in the Monastery
The Three Search for Their Master in Black Pine Forest
The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples came to the Meditation Monastery where they met the lamas
and were given a vegetarian meal. When the four of them had eaten the girl was also fed. By now night was
gradually falling and the lamp was lit in the abbot's lodgings. The lamas, who wanted to ask the Tang Priest
about why he was going to fetch the scriptures and were also eager for a look at the girl, stood packed together
in rows under the lamp. "Abbot," said Sanzang to the lama he had first met, "when we leave your monastery
tomorrow what will the road West be like?" Before answering, the lama fell to his knees. Sanzang quickly
helped him up and said, "Stand up, please. Why do you greet me in this way when I ask about the road?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1125
"When you travel West tomorrow, reverend sir, you will find that the road is level," the lama replied. "There
is no need to worry. There is just one thing at present that is rather awkward. I wanted to tell you about it as
soon as you came in, but I was afraid that it would offend your distinguished self. I only venture to tell you
now that the meal is over that you will be most welcome to spend the night in the young lamas' room after
your long, hard journey from the East. But it would not be right for the lady Bodhisattva to do so. I don't know
where I should invite her to sleep."
"Your suspicions are not called for, abbot," Sanzang replied, "and you should not suppose that my disciples
and I have wicked ideas. When we were coming through Black Pine Forest this morning we found this girl
tied to a tree. My disciple Sun Wukong refused to save her, but out of my enlightened heart I rescued her and
have brought her here for you to put up, abbot."
"As you have been so generous, reverend Father," the abbot replied, "we can set out a straw mattress behind
the devarajas in the Devaraja Hall for her to sleep on."
"That's splendid," Sanzang said, "splendid." After this the young lamas took the girl to sleep in the back of the
hall while in the abbot's lodgings Sanzang urged the officials of the monastery to put themselves at their ease,
whereupon they all dispersed.
"We have had a hard day," Sanzang said to Brother Monkey. "We must go to bed early and be up early in the
morning." They all slept in the same room, guarding the master and not daring to leave him. Later that night
The moon rose high and all was peaceful;
The Street of Heaven was quiet and nobody moved.
Bright was the Silver River; the stars shone clearly;
The drum in the tower hastened the changing watch.
We will say nothing more of the night. When Monkey rose at first light he told Pig and Friar Sand to get the
luggage and the horse ready then urged the master to start out. But Sanzang wanted to sleep longer and would
not wake up, so Monkey went up to him to call, "Master."
The master raised his head but still could make no reply. "What will you say, Master?" Monkey asked.
"Why is my head spinning," Sanzang replied, "why are my eyes swollen, and why an I aching all over from
my skin to my bones?"
When Pig heard this he stretched out his hand to feel the master's body. It was feverish. "Now I understand,"
said the idiot with a grin. "He had several bowls too many of last night's free rice and went to sleep
head−down. It's indigestion."
"Nonsense," shouted Monkey, "Let me ask the master what's really the matter."
"When I got up in the middle of the night to relieve myself," Sanzang replied, "I did not put my hat on. I think
I must have caught a chill in the wind."
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1126
"I'm sure you're right," said Monkey, "Can you travel now?"
"I cannot even sit up," Sanzang replied, "let alone mount the horse. The journey will have to wait."
"What a thing to say, Master," said Monkey, "As the saying goes, 'A teacher for a day is one's father for life.'
As your disciples we are like your sons. There's another saying that
A son does not have to shit silver or gold;
As long as be can do what's needed he'll be fine.
If you're not feeling well you shouldn't be worrying about the journey being delayed. There'll be no problem
about waiting for a few days." The three brother−disciples all looked after their master. The morning was
followed by midday and dusk, and after a good night dawn returned. Time fled, and three days had soon
passed.
The morning after that Sanzang tried to sit up, calling, "Wukong, as I have been very ill these last couple of
days I have not asked you before: have people been giving food to the lady Bodhisattva we rescued?"
"What are you bothering about her for?" laughed Monkey, "What you should be concerned with is your own
illness."
"Yes, yes," said Sanzang. "Help me up and fetch me paper, brush and ink. Borrow an inkstone here in the
monastery."
"What do you want them for?" Monkey asked.
"I want to write a letter," Sanzang replied. "I shall seal it up with our passport and ask you to deliver it for me
to His Majesty Emperor Taizong in Chang'an."
"Easy," said Monkey, "I may not be much good at anything else, but when it comes to delivering letters I'm
the champion of the whole world. So wrap the letter up and give it to me. I'll take it to Chang'an in a single
somersault, give it to the Tang Emperor, and come back with another somersault before your brush and
inkstone have dried up. But why do you want to write a letter? Tell me what you want to say in the
letter−−you can write it down later."
"This is what I will write," said Sanzang, weeping:
"Your subject beats his head three times upon the ground,
With a triple shout of 'Long live Your Majesty' as I bow to my lord.
The civil and military officials ate all present,
And four hundred courtiers all listen to what is said.
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1127
Years ago I left the East on your command,
Hoping to see the Buddha on the Vulture Peak.
But on my journey I have met with obstructions;
And been delayed by unexpected disaster along the way.
My illness is grave; I cannot move one step;
The gate to Buddha is as distant as the gate to heaven.
I will not live to bring back the scriptures;
I submit with respect that a new envoy should be sent."
When Monkey heard this he could not help bursting out into uproarious laughter. "You're hopeless, Master,"
he said, "thinking that sort of thing after just a touch of illness. If you were seriously ill you'd only have to ask
me to find out whether you were going to live or die. I have my own special way of dealing with it. I'd ask,
'Which king of the Underworld dared think of this? Which of the judges issued the warrant? Which demon
messenger is coming to fetch him?' If they make me angry I'll lose my temper the way I did when I made
havoc in Heaven, smash my way into the Underworld with my cudgel, capture the ten kings and rip the
sinews out of every one of them. I'll show them no mercy."
"Stop that boasting, disciple," Sanzang replied. "I am very ill."
"Brother," said Pig, going up to him, "it's very awkward to have the master saying he's in a bad way and you
insisting he isn't. Let's settle things as quickly as we can, sell the horse, pawn the luggage, buy a coffin to bury
the master in and split up."
"You're talking out of turn again, you idiot," Monkey replied. "What you don't realize is that the master used
to be our Tathagata Buddha's second disciple. His original name was the Venerable Golden Cicada. This is
great hardship he has to endure because he once slighted the Buddha's Dharma."
"But, brother," Pig replied, "even if the master did slight the Buddha's Dharma he was exiled to the East and
born into another body amid the sea of right and wrong and the battlefield of tongues. He swore an oath to go
to the Western Heaven, worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. Every time he's met an evil spirit he's
been tied up; and every time he's come across a monster he's been hung up. He's had to put up with every kind
of agony. That should be enough. Why has he had to be ill as well?"
"This is something you wouldn't know about," Monkey replied. "The master once dropped off to sleep instead
of listening to the Buddha teaching the Dharma, and as he drowsed he trod on a grain of rice with his left foot.
That is why he has to be ill for three days in the lower world."
"So goodness only knows how many years someone who eats as messily as I do will have to be ill," replied a
shocked Pig.
"Brother," Monkey replied, "the Buddha will spare ordinary creatures such as you. There's something else you
don't know. As the poet said,
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1128
Hoeing millet in the noonday sun;
Sweat drops on the ground beneath the millet.
Who understands that of the food that's in the bowl,
Every single grain was won through bitter toil?
The master will only be ill today. Tomorrow he'll be better."
"I am feeling different today from how I did yesterday," said Sanzang. "My throat is absolutely parched. Go
and find some cold water somewhere for me to drink."
"Fine," Monkey replied. "If water's what you want, Master, that means you're better. I'll go and fetch some."
Monkey at once took the begging bowl and went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery, where he came
across all the monks red−eyed and sobbing with grief. The only thing was that they dared not cry aloud.
"Don't be so petty, little monks," said Brother Monkey. "Before we leave we'll thank you for the days we've
spent here, and we'll pay for our cooking fuel and lighting by the day. You really shouldn't be such pustules."
"We wouldn't dare accept it," the lamas said at once, falling to their knees, "we wouldn't dare."
"What do you mean, you wouldn't dare?" said Monkey. "It must be that long−snouted monk of ours who has
an enormous appetite. He'd eat you out of house and home."
"My lord," the lamas replied, "there are over a hundred senior and junior lamas in this monastery. If each of us
kept you for a single day we could afford to support you for over a hundred days. We're not the sort of
skinflints who'd calculate what you will cost us in food."
"If you're not working out the cost then why are you sobbing?" Monkey asked.
"Lord," the lamas replied, "there's an evil monster in the monastery. We don't know which mountain it's from.
Last night we sent two junior lamas to strike the bell and beat the drum. We heard the sound of the bell and
the drum but the lamas never came back. When we looked for them the next day all we found were their
monk's hats and shoes lying in the courtyard at the back and their skeletons. They had been eaten. In the three
days you have been here six lamas have disappeared from the monastery. That's why we can't help being
frightened and grieved. When we realized that your venerable master was ill we couldn't stop these tears
stealing out even though we kept the news to ourselves."
"Say no more," said Brother Monkey, who was both shocked and delighted by what he heard. "It must be an
evil monster who's killing people here. I'll wipe it out for you."
"My lord," the lamas replied, "any evil spirit worthy of the name has magical powers. It's bound to be able to
ride clouds, come out of the underworld and disappear again. As the ancients put it so well, 'Trust not the
straightest of the straight; beware of the inhuman human.' Please don't take offence, my lord, when we say that
if you can rid our monastery of this scourge that would be a great happiness for us. But if you can't catch it
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1129
things will be pretty difficult."
"What do you mean by things being pretty difficult?" Monkey asked.
"We will be honest with you, my lord," the lamas replied. "Although there are only a hundred or so of us
lamas in this monastery we all became monks as children:
When our hair grows we have it shaved off;
Our clothes are patched with rags.
We rise in the morning to wash our faces,
Then bow with hands together
In submission to the Great Way.
At night we tidy up, burn incense,
And piously pray,
Chanting the name of Amitabha.
When we look up we see the Buddha
On his ninefold lotus throne
Well−versed in the Three Vehicles,
Riding in his mercy on clouds of dharma,
And we long to see the Sakyamuni in the Jeta park.
Looking down we see into our hearts,
Accept the Five Prohibitions,
Pass through a thousand aeons,
And live each life amid the countless dharmas,
Hoping to understand emptiness and the impermanence of matter.
When the benefactors come,
Old, young, tall, short, fat, thin,
We each beat wooden fish,
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1130
Strike bronze chimes,
Slowly and deliberately,
With the two rolls of the Lotus Sutra
And the short Litany of the Emperor of Liang.
When the benefactors do not come,
New, old, strange, familiar, rustic, smart,
We put our hands together,
Eyes shut,
Silent,
Entering meditation on the rush mats,
Firmly closing the gates under the moon.
Let the orioles sing and other birds chirp in idle strife:
They cannot mount our expeditions and compassionate chariot of dharma.
This is why we cannot subdue tigers and dragons,
Or recognize monsters and spirits.
If, my lord, you provoked the evil monster,
To which we hundred and more lamas would be but a single meal,
All of us living creatures would fall to the wheel of rebirth,
This ancient monastery of meditation would be destroyed,
And finally there would be no light at the Tathagata's assembly.
This would cause great troubles."
When Brother Monkey heard the lamas say this anger surged up from his heart and hatred from his gall.
"What a stupid lot you lamas are!" he shouted at the top of his voice. "Are you only aware of those evil
spirits? Do you know nothing of what I've done?"
"Really we don't," the lamas replied in very quiet voices.
"Then I'll tell you briefly about it," Monkey said.
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1131
"I used to subdue tigers and dragons on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit;
I once went up to Heaven and made great havoc in its palace.
When I was hungry I nibbled just two or three
Of Lord Lao Zi's elixir tablets;
When I was thirsty I sipped six or seven cups
Of the Jade Emperor's own wine.
When I glare with my golden eyes that are neither black nor white,
The sky turns deathly pale
While the moon is hidden in cloud.
When I wield my gold−banded cudgel that's the right length,
It strikes unseen
And leaves no trace behind.
What do I care about big or little monsters,
However rough or vicious they may be?
Once I go for them
They may run away, nimble about, hide or panic.
Whenever I grab one
They'll be filed down, cooked, ground to bits or pulverized in a mortar.
I'm like one of the eight immortals crossing the sea,
Each of whom gives a unique display of his magical powers.
Lamas, I'll catch that evil spirit and show it to you:
Then you'll know what sort of person this Monkey is."
When the lamas heard this they nodded and said quietly, "From the way this damned baldy is shooting his
mouth off and talking big there must be something behind it all."
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1132
They all made polite noises of respectful assent except for the older lama who said, "Wait. Your master is ill,
and catching the evil spirit is not as important as that. As the saying goes,
When a young gentleman goes to a feast
He either gets drunk or eats till he's filled.
When a strong warrior goes into battle
He either is wounded or gets himself killed.
If you two fight it out here you may well get your master into trouble too. It's not a sound idea."
"You're right," said Monkey, "you're right. I'll take my master a drink of cold water and be right back."
Picking up the begging bowl he filled it with cold water, went out of the monastery kitchen and back to the
abbot's lodgings and called, "Master, cold water for you." Sanzang, who was just then suffering torments of
thirst, raised his head, held the bowl with both hands, and took only one sip of the water. It really was a case
of
A drop when you're thirsty is just like sweet dew;
Get the right medicine and you'll feel good as new.
Seeing the venerable elder gradually recovering his spirits and looking less worried Monkey asked, "Could
you manage some soup and other food, Master?"
"That cold water was a magical cure," Sanzang replied. "I have already half recovered from my illness. I
would like some food if there is any."
"The master's better," Monkey shouted repeatedly at the top of his voice. "He wants some soup and other
food." He told the lamas to arrange some at once. They washed and boiled rice, made noodles, cooked
pancakes, steamed breadrolls, and prepared vermicelli soup. Four or five tables of food were carried in, but
the Tang Priest ate only half a bowl of rice gruel, while Monkey and Friar Sand managed only a tableful
between them. Pig gobbled up the rest. The dishes were then taken out, the lamp was lit, and the lamas
dispersed.
"How long have we been here now?" Sanzang asked.
"Three whole days," Monkey replied. "By tomorrow evening it will be four days."
"We could have covered a lot of distance in three days," Sanzang replied.
"Never mind about the distance, Master," said Monkey. "We'll be on our way tomorrow."
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1133
"Yes," said Sanzang, "even if I am still a little poorly there is nothing that can be done."
"If we're setting out tomorrow let me catch the evil spirit tonight," said Monkey.
"What evil spirit?" Sanzang asked in astonishment. "There's an evil spirit in this monastery that I'm going to
catch for them," Monkey replied.
"But how can you be having ideas like that before I have even recovered from my illness?" Sanzang asked. "If
that monster has magical powers and you fail to catch it, then it will kill me, won't it?"
"You're always running people down," Monkey replied. "Wherever we go I subdue evil creatures. Have you
ever seen me come off second best? That could only happen if I did nothing. If I act I'm bound to win."
"Disciple," said Sanzang, clutching him, "the saying is quite right that goes:
Do people a good turn whenever you can;
If it is possible treat them with mercy.
Worrying cannot compare with true kindness;
Better be patient than strive for supremacy."
In the face of his master's impassioned pleas and refusal to allow him to subdue the monster, Monkey could
only speak frankly.
"I'll be honest with you, Master," he said. "The evil spirit has been eating people here."
"Who has it eaten?" Sanzang asked with shock.
"In the three days we've been here it's eaten six of this monastery's young lamas," Monkey said, to which
Sanzang replied:
"Foxes will grieve at the death of the hare;
Creatures will all for their own kind show care.
As it has eaten monks from this monastery and I am a monk too I will let you go, but do be careful."
"No need to tell me," said Monkey, "I'll wipe it out the moment I get my hands on it."
Watch him as he tells Pig and Friar Sand in the lamplight to guard the master. When he leapt happily out of
the abbot's lodgings and went back to the Buddha Hall he looked and saw that though there were stars in the
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1134
sky the moon had not yet risen and it was dark inside the hall. He breathed out some of his magic fire to light
the glazed lamp then beat the drum that stood to the East and struck the bell to the West. That done, he shook
himself and turned himself into a young lama of only eleven or twelve who was wearing a yellow silk shirt
and a white cotton tunic, striking a wooden fish with his hand as he recited a sutra. He waited till the first
watch without seeing anything happen. The waning moon rose only in the second watch. Then a roaring wind
could be heard. It was a splendid wind:
Black mists cast the sky into darkness;
Gloomy clouds cover the earth with murk.
Inky black in every quarter,
All enveloped in indigo.
At first the wind raises dust and dirt;
Then it blows down trees and ravages woods.
Amid the dust and dirt the stars still shine;
When trees go down and woods are ravaged the moonlight is obscured.
It blows so hard the Moon Goddess holds tight to the sala tree
And the Jade Hare hunts all around for the medicine dish.
The Nine Bright Shiner star lords shut their gates;
The dragon kings of the four seas close their doors.
The city god in his temple looks for the little devils;
Immortals in the sky cannot ride their clouds.
The kings of the Underworld search for their horse−faced demons
While the panicking judges get their turbans in a tangle.
The wind blows so hard it moves Mount Kunlun's rocks,
And churns up the waves on rivers and lakes.
As soon as the wind had passed by there was a fragrance of musk and incense and the tinkling of pendants.
When Monkey looked up he saw that a woman of great beauty was going towards the Buddha Hall. Monkey
mumbled the words of a sutra for all he was worth. The woman went up to him, put her arms around him and
asked, "What's that sutra you're reciting?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1135
"One I vowed to," said Monkey.
"But why are you still reciting it when the others are all asleep?" she insisted.
"I vowed to, so why shouldn't I?" Monkey replied.
Keeping a tight hold on him, the woman kissed his lips and said, "Let's go round the back for a bit of fun."
Monkey deliberately turned his head aside as he replied, "Stop being so naughty."
"Do you know how to tell people's fortunes from their faces?" the woman asked.
"I know a bit about it," Monkey replied.
"What can you tell about me?" she continued. "You look to me rather like someone who's been driven out by
her parents−in−law for carrying on with strangers."
"You're wrong," she replied, "you're wrong.
I have not been driven out by my parents−in−law,
Nor have I carried on with strangers.
Because of my ill fate in an earlier life
I was married to a husband who is much too young
And can't do his staff in the candlelit bedroom:
That is the reason why I have left my husband.
As the stars and moon are so bright tonight and we are fated to come hundreds of miles to meet each other,
let's go round to the garden at the back to make love."
When Brother Monkey heard this he nodded to himself and thought, "So those stupid lamas all died because
they were led astray by lust. Now she's trying to lure me. Lady," he said in reply, "I'm a monk and still very
young. I don't know anything about love−making."
"Come with me and I'll teach you," the woman replied.
"All right then," Monkey thought with an inward smile, "I'll go with her and see how she fixes things."
Shoulder nestling against shoulder and hand in hand the two of them left the Buddha Hall and went straight to
the garden at the back. Here the monster tripped Monkey over and sent him to the ground. With wild calls of
"My darling!" she made a grab for his crotch.
"So you really want to eat me up, my girl," he said, seizing her hand and throwing her off balance so that she
somersaulted to the ground.
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1136
"So you can throw your sweetie to the ground, can you, my darling?" she said.
"If I don't take this chance to finish her off what am I waiting for?" he thought. "As they say, hit first and win,
strike second and lose." He leaned forward with his hands on his hips, sprang to his feet and reverted to his
own form. With a swing of his gold−banded iron cudgel he struck at the monster's head.
In her astonishment she thought, "What a terror this young monk is." When she opened her eyes wide for a
better look she realized that he was the Tang Priest's disciple Monkey, but she was not afraid of him. What
sort of evil spirit was she, you may wonder.
A golden nose,
Snowy white fur.
She makes her home in a tunnel,
Where she is thoroughly safe.
Three hundred years ago, after training her vital forces,
She paid several visits to the Vulture Peak,
Carrying a full load of flowers and wax candles.
Tathagata sent her down from Heaven.
She was a beloved daughter to the Pagoda−carrying Heavenly King;
Prince Nezha treated her as his own sister.
She was no bird that fills up the sea,
Nor was she a tortoise carrying mountains on its back.
She did not fear Lei Huan's swords
Nor was she afraid of Lu Qian's blade.
She came and went
Flowing like the mighty Han and Yangtse;
Moved up and down,
Even up a peak as high as Mounts Taishan and Heng.
Seeing the charming beauty of her face
You would never know she was a mouse−spirit with great powers.

Chapter 81 1137
In the pride in her enormous magic powers she held up a pair of swords that rang out as she parried to left and
right, moving East and West. Although Monkey was rather stronger he could not overpower her. Then magic
winds arose on all sides, dimming the waning moon. It was fine battle they fought in the garden at the back:
Evil winds blew from the ground;
Dim was the light of the waning moon.
Deserted was the hall of the Brahma Kings,
And the devils' cloister could not be clearly seen.
The back garden saw a battle Between the warrior Sun,
A sage in Heaven, And the furry girl,
A queen among women,
Both competing in magical powers and refusing to submit.
One turned her heart in anger from the dark−skinned baldy;
The other glared with his all−seeing eyes at the finely dressed woman.
With swords in her hands,
She is no female Bodhisattva.
The blows of the cudgel
Were as fierce as a living vajrapani's.
The resounding golden band flashed like lightning;
For an instant the iron shone white as a star.
In fine buildings they grabbed at the precious jade;
In golden halls the mandarin duck figurines were smashed.
As the apes howled the moon seemed small;
Vast was the sky as wild geese called.
The eighteen arhats
Applauded in secret;
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1138
Each of the thirty−two devas
Was struck with panic.
The Great Sage Monkey was in such high spirits that his cudgel never missed. Realizing that she was no
match for him, the evil spirit frowned suddenly and thought of a plan as she extricated herself and made off.
"Where do you think you're going, you baggage?" Monkey shouted. "Surrender at once."
The evil spirit paid no attention and fled. When she was hard−pressed by Monkey's pursuit she took the
embroidered shoe off her left foot, blew on it with a magic breath, said the words of a spell, called out,
"Change!" and turned it into a likeness of herself that came back at him waving a pair of swords. Meanwhile
she turned her real body with a shake into a pure breeze and went.
This was Sanzang's star of disaster. She headed straight for the abbot's quarters, lifted Sanzang up into a
cloud, and, on the instant, before anyone could see anything, she was back at Mount Pitfall and inside the
Bottomless Cave, where she told her underlings to prepare a vegetarian marriage feast.
The story switches back to Brother Monkey, who fought with desperate anxiety until he was able to seize an
opening and smash the evil spirit to the ground with a single blow, only to find that she was in fact an
embroidered shoe. Realizing that he had fallen for a trick he went straight back to see the master. But was the
master there? There were only the idiot and Friar Sand muttering together. His chest bursting with fury,
Monkey put all thought of what he ought to do out of his head and raised his cudgel to lay about him.
"I'll kill the pair of you," he shouted, "I'll kill the pair of you."
The idiot was desperate, but there was no way for him to escape. Friar Sand, however, as a general from the
magic mountain who had seen a great deal, adopted a very mild and conciliatory approach when he stepped
forward, knelt down and said, "Elder brother, I understand. I'm sure that after you've killed us two you intend
to go straight back home instead of rescuing the master."
"When I've killed you two I'm going to rescue him myself," Monkey retorted.
"How can you say that?" replied Friar Sand with a smile. "Without us two it would be a case of
You can't spin a thread from only one strand
Or clap with the palm of a single hand.
Who'd look after the luggage or the horse for you? We'd do much better to forget our differences and fight
side by side like Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya than to have a battle of wits like Sun Bin and Pang Juan. As the
old saying goes,
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1139
To kill a tiger you need your brothers' help;
Have fathers and sons fight together in battle.
I hope you will spare us, brother, so that tomorrow morning we can all work together with a single mind in
our search for the master." Although his magical powers were tremendous Monkey knew what was right and
needed at the time, so that Friar Sand's entreaties made him change his mind.
"Get up, Pig and Friar Sand," he said. "But when we hunt for the master tomorrow you'll have to make a real
effort." The idiot was so grateful at being let off that he would gladly have promised Monkey half the sky.
"Brother," Friar Sand said, "leave it all to me." The three brother disciples were so anxious that none of them
could sleep. They wished they could make the sun rise in the East with a nod of the head and blow all the stars
out of the sky with a single breath.
After sitting there till dawn the three of them packed up and were about to get out, only to find the gateway
barred by one of the lamas, who asked, "Where are you going, gentlemen?"
"This is most embarrassing," Monkey replied with a smile. "Yesterday I boasted to all the monks that I'd
capture the evil spirit for them. So far from me capturing her she's made my master disappear. We're off to
look for him."
"My lord," said the lamas with horror, "our trivial problem has got your master involved. Where will you look
for him?"
"I know where I'll look," Monkey replied.
"Even though you're going please don't be in such a hurry," said the lamas. "Have some breakfast first." Two
or three bowls of hot gruel were brought in that Pig cleaned up with great gusto.
"What fine monks," he said. "When we've found the master we'll come back here to see you again."
"What you mean is come back to eat their food," said Monkey. "Go and see if the girl is still in the devarajas'
hall."
"She's gone, my lord," the lamas said, "she's gone. She has spent only one night there and is gone the next
morning." Monkey cheerfully took his leave of the lamas and made Pig and Friar Sand lead the horse and
carry the luggage as they headed back East.
"Brother," said Pig, "you're wrong. Why are we going East?"
"You wouldn't know," said Monkey. "That girl who was tied up in the Black Pine Forest the other day−−I saw
through her with my fiery eyes and golden pupils, but you all thought she was a good person. And now it's her
who's eaten the monks and her who's carried the master off. You all did a fine thing rescuing that 'lady
Bodhisattva'. As she's carried the master off we're going back the way we came to look for her."
"Good, good," sighed the other two with admiration. "You're much cleverer than you look. Let's go."
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1140
The three of them hurried back into the forest, where this was what could be seen:
Piles of cloud,
Heavy mists,
Many a layer of rock,
A twisting path.
The tracks of foxes and hares cross each other;
Tiger, leopard, jackal and wolf move in and out of the undergrowth.
With no sign of a monster to be seen in the wood
They do not know where Sanzang might be found.
In his anxiety Monkey pulled out his cudgel, shook himself and made himself look as he had when he made
great havoc in Heaven, with three heads, six arms and six hands wielding three cudgels. With these he lashed
out furiously and noisily among the trees.
"Friar Sand," said Pig when he saw this, "not finding the master has made him go off his head." In fact
Monkey had beat a way through the trees and flushed out two old men−−the mountain god and the local
deity−−who went up to him, knelt down and said, "Great Sage, the god of this mountain and the local deity
pay their respects."
"That rod certainly gets results," said Pig. "He clears a path with it and flushes out the mountain god and the
local deity. If he cleared another path he'd even flush out an evil star."
"Mountain god, local deity," said Monkey, "you're a disgrace. You're hand in glove with the bandits here.
When they make a good haul they buy pigs and sheep to sacrifice to you. On top of that you're accomplices of
the evil spirit. You helped her kidnap my master and bring him here. Where's he being hidden? If you want to
be spared a beating tell me the truth right now."
"Great Sage," the two gods said with alarm, "you are misjudging us. The evil spirit doesn't live on our
mountain or come within our jurisdiction. But when the wind blows at night we have heard a thing or two
about her."
"Tell me everything you know," said Monkey.
"The evil spirit carried your master off to a place over three hundred miles due South of here," the local deity
replied. "There's a mountain there called Mount Pitfall with a cave in it called the Bottomless Cave. He was
taken there by a disguised evil spirit from that cave." This news gave Monkey a shock that he did not reveal.
Shouting at the mountain god and the local deity to dismiss them he put his magical appearance away, turned
back into himself and said to Pig and Friar Sand, "The master's a long way from here."
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1141
"If it's a long way let's go there by cloud," Pig replied.
The splendid idiot went ahead on a wild wind followed by Friar Sand on a cloud. As the white horse had
originally been a dragon's son he too came by wind and mist as he carried the luggage on his back. The Great
Sage set off by somersault as he headed due South, and before long a high mountain came into view that was
blocking the way for the clouds.
The three of them took hold of the horse and stopped their clouds. This is what the mountain looked like:
The summit touched the azure sky,
Its peaks joined with the blue of the heavens.
Trees by the million grew on every side,
While flying birds sung noisily all around.
Tigers and leopards moved in packs,
Water deer and roebuck walked through the bushes.
On the Southern slopes rare flowers bloomed fragrant;
On the Northern side the snow never melted.
Steep and craggy were its ridges,
Sheer were its overhangs and rockfaces.
Pinnacles shot straight up
And deep ravines curved all around.
It was dark green among the pines,
And the rocks were jagged.
It struck fear into the traveler's heart.
No sign could be seen of woodcutters,
And the immortal boys picking herbs had vanished.
The tigers and leopards here could make mists,
And all the foxes set winds roaring.
Journey to the West
Chapter 81 1142
"Brother," said Pig, "this mountain's so high and sheer there must be evil on it."
"Goes without saying," Monkey replied. "High mountains all have monsters; there's never a steep ridge
without spirits. Friar Sand," he called, "you and I are going to stay here while we send Pig into the mountain
hollows to look around and find out the best way for us to take. If there really is a cave palace he must
discover where the entrance is. Find everything out so that we can go in together to find the master and rescue
him."
"Just my lousy luck," said Pig, "having to go first and take the brunt."
"Last night you said we could leave it all to you," Monkey replied, "so why are you trying to get out of it
now?"
"Stop shouting at me," Pig said. "I'm going." The idiot put down his rake, tugged at his clothes and leapt
empty−handed down from the mountain to find the path.
If you don't know whether this departure was to be for good or ill listen to the explanation in the next
installment.
Chapter 82
The Girl Seeks the Male
The Primal Deity Guards the Way
The story tells how Pig leapt down the mountainside and found a narrow path. After following it for nearly
two miles he came across two she−monsters drawing water from a well. How did he know that they both were
monsters? Each of them had on her head an extremely unfashionable hair−style held up by bamboo slivers
that stood one foot two or three inches high.
"Evil monsters," Pig called, going up to them.
The two of them looked at each other and said. "What an outrageous monk. We don't know him and we've
never had words with him. So why did he call us evil monsters?" In their fury the monsters raised the pole
with which they were going to carry the water and struck at Pig's head.
After a few blows that he could not ward off as he was unarmed, the idiot rushed back up the mountain with
his head covered by both hands shouting, "Brother! Go back! The monsters are vicious."
"What's so vicious about them?" Monkey asked.
"There were two evil spirits drawing water from the well in the hollow," said Pig, "and they hit me three or
four times with their carrying−pole just because I spoke to them."
"What did you call them?" Monkey asked.
"Evil monsters," Pig replied.
"You got off lightly then," laughed Monkey.
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1143
"I'm most obliged for your concern," replied Pig. "My head has swollen up where they hit it, and you tell me
I've got off lightly."
"Soft words will get you anywhere on earth; act rough and you won't move a single step," replied Monkey.
"As they're local fiends from round here and we're monks from far away you'd have had to be a bit polite even
if you'd had fists growing all over your body. Do you think they should have hit me instead of you? You were
the one who called them evil monsters. Courtesy first!"
"I never realized," said Pig.
"Living on human flesh in the mountains since childhood as you have," said Monkey, "can you recognize two
kinds of tree?"
"I don't know," Pig said. "Which two trees?"
"The willow and the sandalwood," Monkey replied. "The willow has a very soft nature, so that craftsmen can
carve it into holy images or make statues of the Tathagata out of it. It's gilded, painted, set with jewels,
decorated with flowers, and many worshippers burn incense to it. It receives unbounded blessings. But the
sandalwood is so hard that it's used as the pressing−beam in the oil−press with iron hoops round its head, and
it's hit with iron hammers too. The only reason it suffers like this is because it's to hard."
"You should have told me all this before," said Pig, "then I wouldn't have been beaten."
"Now go back and find out the truth," said Brother Monkey.
"But if I go there again they'll recognize me," Pig replied.
"Then turn into something else," said Monkey.
"But even if I do turn into something else, brother, how am I to question them?" asked Pig.
"When you look different go up to them and bow to them," Monkey replied. "See how old they are. If they're
about the same age as us call them 'Miss,' and if they're a lot older call them 'Lady.'"
"What a terrible climb−down: why should we be treating them as our relations when they're strangers from
this far away?" said Pig.
"That's not treating them as relations," replied Monkey. "Its just a way of getting the truth out of them. If
they're the ones who've got our master we'll be able to act; and if it isn't them we won't lose any time before
going to fight elsewhere."
"You're right," said Pig. "I'm going back."
The splendid idiot tucked his rake in his belt, went down into the hollow, shook himself and turned into a far,
dark−skinned monk. He swaggered as he went up to the monsters, chanted a loud "na−a−aw" of respect and
said, "Respectful greetings, ladies."
"This monk's much better," the two monsters said with delight. "He expresses his respects and knows how to
address us properly." Then they asked him, "Where are you from, venerable elder?"
"From somewhere," Pig replied.
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1144
"And where are you going?" they asked.
"Somewhere," Pig replied.
"What's your name?" they asked.
"What it is," Pig replied again.
"Better he may be," the monsters said with a laugh, "but he won't tell us about himself. He just echoes our
questions."
"Ladies," Pig asked, "why are you fetching water?"
"You wouldn't know, monk," the demons replied with smiles. "Our lady brought a Tang Priest back to the
cave last night and she wants to look after him well. As the water in our cave is none too clean she's sent us
two to fetch some of this good water produced by the mating of the Yin and the Yang. She's laid on a
vegetarian banquet as well for the Tang Priest; she's going to marry him this evening."
As soon as he heard this the idiot rushed straight back up the mountain shouting. "Friar Sand, bring the
luggage here at once. We're dividing it up."
"Why, brother?" Friar Sand asked.
"When we've divided it up you can go back to man−eating in the Flowing Sands River," Pig replied, "I'll
return to Gao Village to see my wife, Big Brother can play the sage on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and
the white dragon can be a dragon in the ocean again. The master's getting married in this evil spirits cave.
Let's all go and settle down."
"You're talking nonsense again, you idiot," replied Brother Monkey.
"I bloody well am not," Pig retorted. "Those two evil spirits who were carrying water said a moment ago that
a vegetarian wedding feast is being laid on for the master."
"How can you say things like that when the evil spirits are holding the master prisoner in the cave and he's
longing for us to go in and rescue him?" said Monkey.
"How can we rescue him?" Pig asked.
"You two bring the horse and the luggage, while we go with the two she−monsters as our guides," Monkey
replied. "When we reach the entrance we can act together."
The idiot could only go with Monkey as he followed the two monsters for five or six miles deep into the
mountains before suddenly disappearing. "So the master was captured by a devil in broad daylight,"
exclaimed Pig with surprise.
"You've got good eyesight," said Monkey. "How can you possibly tell what they really were?"
"Those two monsters were carrying the water along when suddenly they disappeared. They must be daytime
devils."
"I think they went into a cave," said Monkey. "Wait while I go to have a look."
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1145
The splendid Great Sage opened his fiery eyes with their golden pupils and scanned the whole mountain. He
saw no movement, but did spot a ceremonial archway most intricately made with many flowers and colours,
triple eaves and fourfold decorations in front of the cliff. Going closer with Pig and Friar Sand he saw four
large words written on it:
PITFALL MOUNTAIN: BOTTOMLESS CAVE
"Brothers," said Monkey, "here's the evil spirits' archway, but I still don't know where the entrance is."
"Can't be far," said Friar Sand, "can't be far. Let's have a good look for it." When they turned round to look
they saw a great rock over three miles around at the foot of the mountain beneath the archway. In the middle
of it was a hole the size of a water−vat, which had become very slippery by repeated climbing.
"Brother," said Pig, "that's where the evil spirits go in and out of their cave."
"That's very strange," said Monkey. "To be frank with the two of you, I've captured quite a few evil spirits
since I started escorting the Tang Priest, but I've never seen a cave palace like this one before. Pig, you go
down first and find out how deep it is. Then I'll be able to go in and rescue the master."
"It'll be hard," said Pig with a shake of his head, "very hard. I'm very clumsy. If I tripped and fell in it might
take me two or three years to reach the bottom."
"How deep is it then?" Monkey asked.
"Look," Pig replied, and as the Great Sage leant over the edge of the hole to take a careful look he saw to his
astonishment that it was very deep indeed and must have measured over a hundred miles around.
"It's very, very deep, brother," he turned round to say.
"Go back then," Pig replied. "The master's beyond saving."
"What a thing to say!" Monkey retorted. "'Have no thoughts of being lazy; put idleness out of your mind.' Put
the luggage down, and tether the horse to one of the legs of the archway. You and Friar Sand must block the
entrance with your rake and staff while I go inside to explore. If the master really is inside I'll drive the evil
spirits out with my iron cudgel, and when they reach the entrance you mustn't let them out. We'll only be able
to kill the evil spirits and rescue the master if we work together." The other two accepted their orders.
Monkey sprang into the hole, and under his feet tea thousand coloured clouds appeared, while a thousand
layers of auspicious mist shielded him. He was soon at the bottom, which was a very long way down. Inside
all was bright; there was the same sunshine, winds, flowers, fruit and trees as in the world above.
"What a splendid place," Monkey thought. "It reminds me of the Water Curtain Cave that Heaven gave me in
the place where I was born. This is another cave paradise." As he looked around he saw a gate−tower with
double eaves around which grew many clumps of pine and bamboo. Inside were many buildings.
"This must be where the evil spirit lives," he thought. "I'll go in and find out what's up. No, wait. If I go in like
this she'll recognize me. I'd better transform myself." With a shake and a hand−spell he turned himself into a
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1146
fly and flew lightly up to land on the gate−tower and listen in. From here he saw the monster sitting at her
ease in a thatched pavilion. She was dressed far more beautifully than she had been when they rescued her in
the pine forest or when she had tried to catch Monkey in the monastery:
Her hair was piled in a crow−black coiffure;
She wore a green velvet waistcoat.
Her feet were a pair of curving golden lotuses;
Her fingers were as delicate as bamboo shoots in spring.
Her powdered face was like a silver dish,
And her red lips were as glossy as a cherry.
She was a regular beauty,
Even more lovely than the lady on the moon.
After capturing the pilgrim monk that morning
She was going to know the pleasure of sharing his bed.
Monkey said nothing as he listened out for what she might say. Before long the cherry of her lips parted as she
said with great pleasure, "Lay on a vegetarian feast, my little ones, and quick. My darling Tang Priest and I
are going to be man and wife afterwards."
"So it's true," thought Brother Monkey, grinning to himself. "I thought Pig was just joking. I'd better fly in and
find the master. I wonder what state of mind he's in. If he's been led astray I'm leaving him here." When he
spread his wings and flew inside to look he saw the Tang Priest sitting in a corridor behind a trellis covered
with opaque red paper below and left clear above.
Butting a hole through the trellis paper Monkey landed on the Tang Priest's bald head and called, "Master."
"Save me, disciple," replied Sanzang, who recognized Monkey's voice.
"You're useless, Master," said Monkey. "The evil spirit is laying on a feast, and when you've eaten it you two
are getting married. I expect you'll have a son or a daughter to start another generation of monks and nuns.
What have you got to be so upset about?"
When the venerable elder heard this he gnashed his teeth and said, "Disciple, in all the time since I left
Chang'an, accepted you as my follower at the Double Boundary Mountain and started my journey West, when
have I ever eaten meat or had any wicked ideas? Now the evil spirit has captured me she is insisting that I
mate with her. If I lose my true masculine essence may I fall from the wheel of reincarnation and be fixed for
ever behind the Dark Mountains, never to rise again."
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1147
"No need to swear any oaths," said Monkey with a grin. "If you really want to fetch the scriptures from the
Western Heaven I'll take you there."
"I can't remember the way I came in," Sanzang replied.
"Never mind about forgetting," said Monkey. "You won't get out of here as easily as you came in, which was
from the top downwards. If I save you now you'll have to go from the bottom upwards. If you're very lucky
you'll squeeze out through the entrance and get away. But if your luck's out you won't be able to squeeze
through and sooner or later you'll die of suffocation."
"This is terrible," said Sanzang, the tears pouring from his eyes. "What are we to do?"
"No problem," said Monkey, "no problem. The evil spirit's getting some wine prepared for you. You'll have to
drink a goblet of it whether you want to or not. But you must pour it out quickly so that it makes a lot of froth.
Then I can turn myself into a tiny insect and fly under the bubbles. When she gulps me down into her belly I'll
tear her heart and liver to shreds and rip her guts apart. Once I've killed her you'll be able to escape."
"But that would be an inhuman thing to do, disciple," said Sanzang.
"If all you're interested in is being kind you're done for," Monkey replied. "The evil spirit's a murderess. What
do you care so much about her for?"
"Oh well," said Sanzang, "never mind. But you will have to stay with me." Indeed:
The Great Sage Sun guarded Tang Sanzang well;
The pilgrim priest depended on the Handsome Monkey King.
Master and disciple had not even finished their discussion when the evil spirit, who had arranged everything,
came in along the corridor, unlocked the doors and called, "Reverend sir." The Tang Priest dared not reply.
She addressed him again, and again he dared not reply. Why was that? He was thinking that
Divine energy is dispersed by an open mouth;
Trouble starts when the tongue begins to move.
He was thinking with all his heart that if he obstinately refused to open his mouth she might turn vicious and
murder him in an instant. Just when he was feeling confused, wondering which difficult alternative to choose
and asking himself what to do, the evil spirit addressed him as "Reverend sir" for the third time.
The Tang Priest had no choice but to answer, "Here I am, madam." For him to give this reply was to make all
the flesh fall off him. Now everybody says that the Tang Priest is a sincere monk, so how could he reply to the
she−devil when he was on his way to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven?
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1148
What you would not realize is that this was a crisis in which his very survival was at stake, that he had
absolutely no alternative; and although he went through the form of replying he was free of desire inside. But
when the evil spirit heard his reply she pushed the door open, helped the Tang Priest to his feet, held his hand,
stood with her side pressed against his and whispered in his ear. Just look at her as she lays on the charm and
makes herself alluring in every possible way. She did not realize that Sanzang was full of revulsion.
"From the way she's making herself so seductive," Monkey thought with a wry grin to himself, "I'm worried
that she might get the master interested." Indeed:
The monk in demon trouble met a pretty girl;
The she−devil's beauty was truly superb.
Her slender jade eyebrows were like two willow leaves;
Her round face was set off with peach blossom.
Embroidered shoes gave a sight of a pair of phoenixes;
Her crow−black hair was piled high at the temples.
As smiling she led the master by his hand
His cassock was tinged with orchid and musk.
Her arms around him, the she−devil took the master to a thatched pavilion and said, "Reverend sir, I've had a
drink brought here to have with you."
"Lady," said the Tang Priest, "as a monk I can take no impure food."
"I know," the evil spirit replied. "As the water in the cave isn't clean I've sent for some of the pure water from
the mating of the Yin and the Yang up on the mountain, and had a banquet of fruit and vegetables prepared.
After that you and I are going to have some fun." When the Tang Priest went into the pavilion with her this is
what could be seen:
All within the gates
Was decked in silks and embroideries;
Throughout the hall
Incense rose from golden lion censers.
Black−painted inlaid tables were set in rows,
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1149
On which stood dark−lacquered bamboo dishes.
On the inlaid tables
Were all kinds of delicacies;
In the bamboo dishes
Were vegetarian delights:
Crab apples, olives, lotus seeds, grapes, torreya−nuts,
hazelnuts, pine−nuts, lichees, longans, chestnuts, water caltrops, jujubes, persimmons, walnuts, gingko nuts,
kumquats and oranges.
There was the fruit that grows on every hill,
The fresh vegetables of each season;
Beancurd, wheat gluten, tree−ear fungus, fresh bamboo shoots, button mushrooms, gill fungus, yams,
sealwort, agar, day lily fried in vegetable oil,
Hyacinth beans, cowpeas prepared with mature sauces.
Cucumbers, gourds, gingko, turnip greens.
Peeled aubergines were cooked like quails;
Seeded wax gourds
Taro stewed tender and sprinkled with sugar,
Turnips boiled in vinegar.
Pungent chili and ginger made it all delicious;
All the dishes were a balance of bland and salty.
Revealing the tips of her jade fingers she raised a dazzling golden goblet that she filled with fine wine.
"Dearest reverend gentleman," she said, handing it to him, "my darling, have a drink to celebrate our happy
union." Sanzang was covered with embarrassment as he took the wine.
He poured a libation into the air as he prayed silently, "Devas who guard the Dharma, Guardians of the Four
Quarters and the Centre, Four Duty Gods: your disciple Chen Xuanzang has benefited from the secret
protection of all you deities sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin on my journey to pay my respects at the Thunder
Monastery, see the Buddha and seek the scriptures. I have now been captured by an evil spirit on my way. She
is forcing me to marry her and has now handed me this cup of wine to drink. If this really is pure wine I can
force myself to drink it and still be able to succeed and see the Buddha. But if it is impure wine I will be
breaking my vows and fall for ever into the bitterness of the wheel of rebirth."
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1150
The Great Sage Sun made himself tiny and was like a secret informant behind his master's ear. When he spoke
Sanzang was the only one who could hear him. Knowing that his master was normally fond of the pure wine
of grapes he told him to drain the goblet. Sanzang had no choice but to do so, quickly refill the goblet and
hand it back to the evil spirit. As he filled it bubbles of happiness formed on the surface of the wine. Brother
Monkey turned himself into the tiniest of insects and flew lightly under the bubbles. But when the spirit took
the goblet she put it down instead of drinking from it, bowed twice to the Tang Priest and spoke loving words
to him with charming bashfulness. By the time she lifted the cup the bubbles had burst and the insect was
revealed. Not realizing that it was Monkey transformed the evil spirit took it for a real insect, lifted it out with
her little finger and flicked it away.
Seeing that as things were not going as he intended he would be unable to get into her belly Monkey turned
himself into a hungry eagle.
Indeed:
Jade claws, gold eyes and iron wings;
In terrible might he rose above the clouds.
Cunning hares and foxes felt faint at just the sight,
And hid among mountains and rivers for hundred of miles around.
When hungry it chased small birds into the wind,
And rose to the gate of heaven when replete.
Murderous were its talons of steel;
In times of triumph it stayed aloof in the clouds.
Monkey flew up, swung his jade claws, and noisily overturned the tables, smashing all the fruit, vegetables
and crockery, and leaving the Tang Priest alone there as he flew off. This was so terrifying that the she−devil's
heart and gall were split open, and the Tang Priest's flesh and bones were turned crisp. Shivering and shaking,
the evil spirit threw her arms round the Tang Priest and said, "Dearest reverend gentleman, wherever did that
come from?"
"I don't know," Sanzang replied.
"I went to a great deal of trouble to arrange this vegetarian feast for you," the she−devil said. "Goodness only
knows where that feathered brute flew in from and smashed our crockery."
"Smashing the crockery doesn't really matter," the junior demons said, "but all the food has been spilt on the
floor. It's too dirty to eat now." Sanzang by now realized that this was all the result of Monkey's magic, but he
dared not say so.
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1151
"Little ones," said the she−devil, "I realize now. It must be heaven and earth that sent that thing down here
because they can't tolerate my holding the Tang Priest prisoner. Clear all the broken dishes up and lay on
another banquet. Never mind whether it's vegetarian or not. Heaven can be our matchmaker and the earth our
guarantor. After that the Tang Priest and I will become man and wife." We will say no more of her as she took
the Tang Priest to sit in the East corridor.
Instead the story tells of how Monkey flew out, turned back into himself, reached the entrance to the cave and
shouted, "Open up!"
"Friar Sand," Pig shouted, "our big brother's here." As the two of them drew their weapons away Monkey
sprang out.
"Is there an evil spirit in there?" Pig asked, grabbing hold of him. "Is the master in there?"
"Yes, yes," said Monkey.
"The master must be having a hard time in there," said Pig. "Are his arms tied behind his back? Or is he all
roped up? Is she going to steam him or boil him?"
"None of them," Monkey replied. "She'd just had a vegetarian feast served and was going to do it with him."
"So you've been lucky then," said Pig. "You must have drunk a wedding toast."
"Idiot!" retorted Monkey, "Never mind about having a wedding drink. I can hardly keep him alive."
"Then why are you here?" Pig asked.
Monkey told how he had seen the master and done his transformations, ending, "Don't let your fears run away
with you, brothers. The master's here, and when I go back in this time I'll definitely rescue him."
Going back inside, Monkey turned into a fly and landed on the gate−tower to listen. He could hear the
she−devil snorting with fury as she gave instructions within the pavilion.
"Little ones, bring whatever there is, vegetarian or not, and burn paper as offerings to the deities. I'll ask
heaven and earth to be the matchmakers. I'm definitely going to marry him."
When Monkey heard this he smiled to himself and thought, "That she−devil's completely shameless. She's
locked a monk up in her home and now she's going to mess around with him in broad daylight. But don't be in
too much of a hurry. Give me time to go in and have a look round." With a buzz he flew along the corridor to
see the master sitting inside, tears streaming down his face.
Monkey squeezed in, landed on Sanzang's head and called, "Master." Recognizing the voice, Sanzang sprang
to his feet and said with tooth−gnashing fury, "Macaque! Other people get their courage from a big gall, but
they have to wrap their bodies around it. Your gall is so big that you wrap it round your body. You used your
magical powers of transformation to smash the crockery, but what use is that? By fighting that she−devil
you've only made her more sex−crazed than ever. She is arranging a banquet with vegetarian and impure food
all mixed up and is determined to mate with me. Where will this all end?"
Smiling to himself again, Monkey replied, "Don't be angry with me, Master. I've got a way to save you."
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1152
"How will you save me?" the Tang Priest asked.
"When I flew up just now," said Monkey, "I saw that she has a garden behind here. You must lure her into the
garden to fool around and I'll rescue you from there."
"How will you rescue me from the garden?" the Tang Priest asked.
"Go to the peach trees in the garden with her and stay there. Wait till I've flown to a branch of the peach tree
and turned into a red peach. When you want to eat a peach pick the red one first−−that will be me. She'll be
bound to pick one too. You must insist on giving her the red one. Once she's swallowed it I'll be in her
stomach. When I tear her stomach to pieces and rip her guts to shreds she'll be dead and you'll be freed."
"With your powers you ought to fight her," said Sanzang. "Why do you want to get into her stomach?"
"You don't understand, Master," Monkey replied. "If it were easy to get in and out of this cave of hers I would
be able to fight her. But this place is very hard to get into or out of: the way out is complicated and difficult. If
I started a fight with her all the fiends in her den, young and old, would overpower me. Then how would it
end? We must act carefully if we're all to make a clean getaway."
Sanzang nodded, believing all that Monkey said, adding only, "You must stay with me."
"I know," said monkey, "I know. I'll be on your head."
When master and disciple had settled their plan Sanzang leaned forward, took hold of the bars in the corridor's
gates and called out, "Lady, lady."
As soon as she heard this the evil spirit came rushing over, a simpering smile on her face, to ask, "What do
you have to say to me, my wonderful darling?"
"Lady," replied Sanzang, "ever since leaving Chang'an and starting on my journey to the West I have had to
cross mountains and rivers every single day. When I was staying in the Zhenhai Monastery last night I caught
a bad chill and I have been in a sweat today. I was just beginning to feel a little better today when in your
kindness, good lady, you brought me into your immortals' palace. As I have been sitting here all day I am now
feeling in rather low spirits again. Could you take me somewhere to cheer myself up and have a little fun?"
The evil spirit was utterly delighted. "So you're feeling a bit interested, are you, my wonderful darling?" she
said. "You and I will go into the garden for some fun. Little ones," she called, "fetch the key, open the garden
gates, and sweep the paths in the garden." The demons all hurried off to open the gates and tidy the place up.
Meanwhile the evil spirit was opening the screen and helping the Tang Priest out. Just watch the many young
demons−−all willowy beauties with oiled hair and powdered faces−−crowding around the Tang Priest as they
head for the garden. What a splendid monk he was, walking amid these beauties in their gauze and brocade
for no other purpose than to be deaf and dumb. If instead of having an iron heart set on the Buddha he had
been any ordinary man susceptible to wine and women he would never have succeeded in fetching the
scriptures.
When they reached the entrance to the garden the evil spirit whispered seductively, "My wonderful darling,
let's have some fun here−−it'll cheer you up." They went into the garden hand in hand, and when he looked up
he saw that it was indeed a splendid place. This is what could be seen:
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1153
All over the winding paths
Bluish lichens grow.
Secluded gauze windows
Kept dark by embroidered curtains.
When the breeze arises
Silks and brocades float in the air.
When the gentle rain stops falling
The smooth white skin and jade−like flesh are revealed.
The sun−scorched apricot
Is red as an immortal's rainbow clothes spread out to dry;
The plantain in the moonlight
Is bluer than Lady Taizhen waving her feather fan.
Whitewashed walls enclose
The golden orioles that sing in ten thousand willows.
Within the empty halls
Butterflies flit among begonias in the courtyard.
Look at the Hall of Crystallized Perfumes,
The Green Moth Hall,
The Hall to Recover from Drunkenness,
The Hall of Longing,
Rolling up the brilliance, one behind the other.
On the red curtains
Hooks hold tassels like prawn whiskers.
Now look at the Pavilion to Ease Pain
The Pavilion of Simplicity,
The Pavilion of Thrushes,
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1154
The Four Rains Pavilion,
All towering and lofty,
And bearing on decorated tablets
Their names in archaic script.
Look too at the Pool Where Cranes Bathe,
The Goblet−washing Pool,
The Pool of Delight in the Moon,
The Pool for Cleansing Tassels,
Where amid duckweed and algae the gold scales shine.
Then there is the Kiosk of Ink Flowers,
The Kiosk of Strange Boxes,
The Interesting Kiosk,
The Kiosk for Admiring the Clouds
Where bubbles like green ants float on the wine in jade ladles and goblets.
Around the pools and pavilions
Stand rocks from Lake Taihu,
Rocks of purple crystal,
Yingluo rocks,
Jin River rocks,
Greenish and overgrown with tiger−whisker rushes.
East and West of the kiosks and balls are found
A Wooden Mountain,
A Turquoise Screen Mountain,
A Howling Wind Mountain,
A Jade Mushroom Mountain,
All covered in phoenix−tail bamboo.

Chapter 82 1155
Trellises of briar roses,
And garden roses,
Growing by a swing,
As a curtain of silk and brocade.
A Pine Pavilion,
A Magnolia Pavilion,
Opposite a Saussurea Pavilion,
Forming a wall of jade with embroidered hangings.
Herbaceous and tree peonies are rivals in luxuriance;
The night−closing magnolias and the jasmine
Are charming every year.
Moist with dewdrops are the purple buds:
They ought to be painted or drawn.
The red hibiscus fills the sky with flaming splendor,
A marvellous subject for poetry.
When it comes to fine scenery
This makes Lang Garden or Penglai not worth a mention;
And as for the flowers,
The finest peonies of Luoyang count for nothing beside them.
In the battle of the blossoms late in the spring
The garden lacks only the flowers of jade.
The venerable elder led the she−devil by the hand as they strolled in the garden, admiring the endless displays
of rare and exotic blooms. As they went through many a hall and pavilion he really did seem to be going into
an exquisite place. Looking up, he realized that he was by the peach grove. Monkey pinched his master's head
to remind him.
Flying to a branch of a peach tree Brother Monkey shook himself and turned into a red peach, and a most
fetchingly red one at that. "Lady," the venerable elder said to the evil spirit, "what beautifully scented flowers
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1156
and ripe fruit you have in this garden.
The blooms are so fragrant bees vie for their nectar;
The birds all compete for the fruit on the branches.
Why are some of the peaches on the trees red and some green?"
"If there were no Yin and Yang in the heavens the sun and moon would not be bright," the evil spirit replied
with a smile. "If there were no Yin and Yang in the earth the plants and trees would not grow. And if there
were no Yin and Yang among people there would be no sexual difference. The peaches on the Southern Yang
side of these trees are red because they ripen first in the sun's heat. The peaches on the Northern Yin side are
green because they get no sun and are still unripe. It's all because of the Yin and the Yang."
"Thank you, lady, for your explanation," Sanzang replied. "I did not know that." He then reached out and
picked a red peach, while the evil spirit also picked a green one.
Sanzang bowed as he handed the red one respectfully to the evil spirit with the words, "Lady, you love what is
attractive, so won't you take this red peach and give me the green one?"
The she−devil made the exchange, thinking with concealed delight, "What a nice monk. He really is a good
man. He is being so loving to me even before we're man and wife." With great pleasure she paid him her
affectionate respects. As the Tang Priest started to eat the green peach at once the evil spirit was delighted to
do likewise, opening her mouth to bite into the red one. When she parted her red lips and revealed her silver
teeth the impatient Monkey did not give her time to bite him but rolled straight down her throat into her
stomach.
"Reverend gentleman," the terrified evil spirit said, "that peach is a terror. Why did it roll straight down and
not let me bite it?"
"Lady," Sanzang replied, "the first ripe fruits of a garden are very delicious. That is why it went down so fast."
"But it shot straight down before I'd had time to spit the stone out," the evil spirit replied.
"Because you are such a lover of what is fine and beautiful and enjoyed it so much," said Sanzang, "you
swallowed it before you could bring the stone out."
Once inside her stomach Monkey turned back into himself. "Master," he called, "no need to argue with her
now. I've succeeded."
"Don't be too hard on her, disciple," Sanzang replied.
"Who are you talking to?" the evil spirit asked when she heard this. "I am talking to my disciple Sun
Wukong," Sanzang replied.
"Where is he?" the evil spirit asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1157
"In your stomach," Sanzang replied. "He was the red peach you have just eaten."
"That's the end of me," exclaimed the evil spirit in horror. "If that ape's got into my stomach I'm dead. Sun the
Novice, why did you go to such lengths to get into my stomach?"
"No particular reason," replied Monkey from inside her. "I just wanted to eat the six leaves of your liver and
your lungs, and your heart with its three hairs and seven apertures. I'm going to clean your insides right out
and leave you a skeleton spirit."
This sent the evil spirit's souls scattering in terror and shivering and shaking she clung tightly to the Tang
Priest and said, "Reverend gentleman, I had thought that
Our destinies were from former lives joined by a red thread;
Our love was as close as the water and the fish.
I never imagined that we lovebirds would be parted
Or that the phoenixes would fly to East and West.
When the waters rose under Lan Bridge the rendezvous failed;
The meeting came to nothing in the misty temple.
After brief joy we are parted once more;
In whatever year will I meet you again?"
When Monkey heard all this from inside her stomach he was afraid that the venerable elder would have
another attack of benevolence and let her talk her way out of the problem. Thereupon he started to wield fist
and foot, striking out in martial postures and leveling everything around him. He punched her stomach almost
to ribbons. Unable to bear the pain, the evil spirit collapsed in the dust, not daring to utter a single word for
some time. As she was not speaking Monkey imagined that she must be dead and eased off.
She then recovered her breath to some extent and called out, "Where are you, little ones?" Now once in the
garden, the creatures had all had the understanding to go off picking flowers, playing in the grass and amusing
themselves, leaving the she−devil alone with the Tang Priest for a romantic conversation. As soon as they
heard her calling they rushed over to see the evil spirit lying on the ground, her face a terrible color as she
groaned, unable to move.
They hurriedly helped her up, crowding round and asking, "What's wrong, madam? Have you had a heart
attack?"
"No, no," the evil spirit replied. "Don't ask any questions. I've got someone inside me. Take the monk outside
if you want to save my life."
Journey to the West
Chapter 82 1158
The junior devils actually did start to carry the Tang Priest, at which Monkey yelled from inside her belly,
"Don't any of you dare carry him. You must take my master out yourself. I'll only spare your life when you've
carried him outside."
This left the evil spirit with no choice as all she cared about was saving her skin. At once she struggled to her
feet, lifted the Tang Priest on her back and headed outside, followed by the junior devils asking, "Where are
you going, Madam?"
To this the evil spirit replied,
"'As long as the lakes and the bright moon remain
I'll surely find somewhere to put my golden hook.'
Once I've taken this wretch outside I'll find myself another man."
The splendid evil spirit went straight by cloud to the mouth of the cave, where the clang of weapons and wild
shouts could be heard.
"Disciple," said Sanzang, "why can I hear weapons outside?"
"It's Pig rubbing his rake," replied Monkey. "Give him a shout."
"Bajie," Sanzang shouted.
"Friar Sand," said Pig when he heard this, "the master's out." The two of them drew back their rake and staff,
letting the evil spirit carry the Tang Priest out. Indeed:
The Mind Ape had subdued a monster from the inside;
The Earth and Wood door guards welcomed the holy monk.
If you don't know whether the evil spirit's life was spared listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 83
The Mind−Ape Recognizes the Refiner of Cinnabar
The Girl Reverts to Her True Nature
The story tells how after Sanzang had been carried out of the cave by the evil spirit Friar Sand went up to him
and asked, "Where is my oldest brother now that you have come out, Master?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1159
"He must know what he's doing," said Pig. "I expect he's exchanged himself for the master to get him out."
"Your brother is in her stomach," Sanzang replied, pointing at the evil spirit.
"It is terribly filthy," Pig said. "Whatever are you doing in there? Come out."
"Open your mouth," said Monkey from inside, "I'm coming out." The she−devil did indeed open her mouth
wide. Monkey made himself very small, sprang up into her throat, and was just about to emerge when he
became worried that she might cheat and bite him. He then pulled out his iron cudgel, blew on it with magic
breath, called "Change!" and turned it into a jujube stone with which he wedged her jaw open. With one
bound he then leapt outside, taking the iron cudgel with him, bowed to resume his own form and raised his
cudgel to strike her. At once she drew a pair of fine swords, parrying his blow with a loud clang. They fought
a splendid battle on the mountain top.
A pair of dancing, flying swords defended her face;
The gold−banded cudgel struck at her head.
One was a heaven−born monkey, the Mind−ape;
The other had the bones of an earth−born girl turned spirit;
The two of them both had been smitten by anger:
Hatred arose at the celebration; the party was ended.
One longed to mate with the primal masculinity,
The other wanted to defeat the incarnation of the female.
When the cudgel was raised to the sky cold mists spread out;
The swords shook up the earth's black dirt like a sieve.
Because the elder would visit the Buddha
They were locked in fierce combat, each showing great prowess.
When water conflicts with fire motherhood is out;
When Yin and Yang cannot combine each goes its own way.
After the two had been fighting for a very long time
The earth moved, the mountains shook and the trees were destroyed.
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1160
The sight of their struggle made Pig grumble resentfully about Monkey. "Brother," he said, turning to Friar
Sand, "our elder brother is messing around. When he was in her stomach just now he could have used his fists
to make her belly red with blood, rip it open and come out. That would have settled her score. Why did he
have to come out through her mouth and fight her? Why did he let her run wild?"
"You're right," Friar Sand replied, "but it was thanks to him that the master was rescued from the depths of the
cave, even if he is in a fight with her now. Let's ask the master to sit here by himself while we two use our
weapons to help our brother beat the evil spirit."
"No, no," said Pig with a wave of his hand. "He's got his magic powers. We'd be useless."
"What a thing to say," retorted Friar Sand. "This is in all of our interests. We may not be much use, but even a
fart can strengthen a breeze."
Now that the idiot's dander was up he brandished his rake and shouted, "Come on!" Ignoring the master, they
rode the wind and went for the evil spirit, striking wildly at her with their rake and staff. The evil spirit, who
was already finding Brother Monkey too much to handle, realized that she would be unable to hold out against
two more of them. At once she turned and fled.
"After her, brothers," Monkey shouted. Seeing that they were so hot on her heels the evil spirit took the
embroidered shoe off her right foot, blew on it with a magic breath, said a spell, called "Change!" and turned
it into her own double swinging a pair of sword. Then she shook herself, turned into a puff of wind and went
straight back. There she was, fleeing for her life because she was no match for them. What happened next was
quite unexpected: Sanzang's evil star had still not gone away. As the evil spirit reached the archway in front of
the entrance to the cave she saw the Tang Priest sitting there by himself, so she went up to him, threw her arm
round him, grabbed the luggage, bit through the bridle, and carried him back inside, horse and all.
The story tells not of her but of Pig, who exploited an opening to fell the evil spirit with one blow of his rake,
only to find that she was really an embroidered shoe.
"You pair of idiots," said Monkey when he saw it. "You should have been looking after the master. Nobody
asked you to help."
"What about that, then, Friar Sand?" said Pig. "I said we shouldn't come here. That ape has had a brainstorm.
We beat the monster for him and he gets angry with us."
"Beaten the monster indeed!" Monkey said. "The monster fooled me yesterday by leaving a shoe behind when
I was fighting her. Goodness knows how the master is now that you've left him. Let's go straight back and
see."
The three of them hurried back to find that the master had disappeared: there was no sign at all of him, the
luggage or the white horse. Pig started rushing all over the place in a panic with Friar Sand searching
alongside him. The Great Sage Sun was also most anxious. As he searched he noticed half of the bridle rope
lying askew beside the path.
Picking it up, he could not hold back his tears as he called in a loud voice, "Master! When I went I took my
leave of you three and the horse, and all I find on my return is this rope." It was indeed a case of
Being reminded of the steed by seeing the saddle,
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1161
Missing the beloved amid one's tears.
The sight of Monkey's tears gave Pig an uncontrollable urge to throw back his head and laugh out loud.
"Blockhead," said Monkey abusively. "Do you want us to break up again?"
"That's not what I mean," said Pig, still laughing. "The master's been carried back into the cave. As the saying
goes, 'third time lucky'. You've already been into the cave twice, so if you go in again you're sure to rescue the
master."
"Very well then," said Monkey, wiping away his tears, "as this is the way things are I have no choice. I'll have
to go back in. You two don't have to worry about the luggage or the horse any more, so guard the cave−mouth
properly."
The splendid Great Sage turned round and sprang into the cave. This time he did no transformations but
appeared in his own dharma form. This is what he was like:
His cheeks looked strange but his heart was strong;
As a monster since childhood his magic was mighty.
A misshapen face that looked like a saddle;
Eyes fiery bright with golden light.
His hairs were harder than needles of steel,
And striking was the pattern of his tigerskin kilt.
In the sky he could scatter a myriad clouds;
In the sea he could stir up thousandfold waves.
Once with his strength he fought heavenly kings,
Putting a hundred and eight thousand warriors to flight.
His title was Great Sage Equaling Heaven;
He was an expert with the gold−banded cudgel.
Today in the West he was using his powers
To return to the cave and rescue Sanzang.
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1162
Watch Monkey as he stops his cloud and heads straight for the evil spirit's residence, where he found the gates
under the gate towers shut. Not caring whether or not it was the right thing to do, he smashed them open with
one swing of his cudgel and charged inside. It was completely quiet and deserted, and the Tang Priest was
nowhere to be seen in the corridor. The tables and chairs in the pavilion and all the utensils had completely
disappeared. As the cave measured over a hundred miles around, the evil spirit had very many hiding places in
it. This was where she had brought the Tang Priest the previous time, only to be found by Monkey, so after
catching him this time she had moved him elsewhere in case Monkey came looking for him again.
Not knowing where they had gone, Monkey stamped his foot and beat his chest with fury, letting himself call
out at the top of his voice, "Master! You are a Tang Sanzang formed in misfortune, a pilgrim monk molded
from disaster. Hmm. I know the way well enough. Why isn't he here? Where should I look for him?"
Just when he was howling with impatience and anxiety his nose was struck by a whiff of incense, which
brought him back to himself. "This incense smoke is coming from the back," he thought, "so I suppose they
must be there." He strode in at the back, his cudgel in his hand, but still saw no sign of life. What he did see
were three side rooms. Near the back wall was a lacquered offertory table carved with dragons on which stood
a gilt incense−burner. From this came heavily scented incense smoke. On the table was a tablet inscribed with
letters of gold to which the offerings were being made. The letters read, "Honoured Father, Heavenly King
Li." In a slightly inferior position was written, "Honoured Elder Brother, Third Prince Nezha."
The sight filled Monkey with delight. He stopped searching for the monster and the Tang Priest, rubbed his
cudgel between his fingers to make it as small as an embroidery needle, tucked it inside his ear, gathered up
the tablet and the incense−burner with a sweep of his arms and went straight back out through the gates on his
clouds. He was still chortling with glee when he reached the mouth of the cave.
When Pig and Friar Sand heard him they unblocked the entrance to the cave and greeted him with, "You look
so happy you must have saved the master, elder brother."
"No need for us to save him," Monkey replied with a smile. "We can ask this tablet for him."
"But that tablet isn't an evil spirit and it can't talk," said Pig, "so how can you ask it for him?"
"Look at it," said Monkey, putting the tablet on the ground. When Friar Sand went up to look he saw
"Honoured Father, Heavenly King Li" and "Honoured Elder Brother, Third Prince Nezha" written on it.
"What does this mean?" Friar Sand asked.
"The evil spirit makes offerings to it," Monkey replied. "When I charged into her place there was nobody
about, only this tablet. I think she must be a daughter of Heavenly King Li and the younger sister of Prince
Nezha who so longed for the lower world that she pretended to be an evil spirit and carried our master off. So
who better to demand the master from? You two keep guard here while I take this tablet up to Heaven to
lodge a complaint with the Jade Emperor and force those heavenly kings to give our master back."
"Brother," said Pig, "there's a saying that goes, 'Bring a capital charge and pay for it with your own head.' You
can only do a thing like that if you're in the right. Besides, a case in the celestial court isn't something to be
started lightly. You'd better tell me what sort of case you're going to bring."
"I know what I'm going to do," Monkey replied. "I'm going to produce this tablet and incense−burner as
evidence and submit a written deposition too."
"What will you write in your deposition?" Pig asked him. "Will you tell me?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1163
To this Brother Monkey replied, "The complainant Sun Wukong, whose age is stated in this document, is the
disciple of the monk Tang Sanzang who is going from the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from
the Western Heaven. He submits a complaint that an imitation evil spirit has committed a kidnap. Li Jing, the
Pagoda−carrying Heavenly King, and his son Prince Nezha have been slack in controlling their women's
quarters. He has allowed his daughter to run away and turn into an evil spirit in the Bottomless Cave in Mount
Pitfall, where she has lured countless deluded people to their deaths. She has now carried my master into a
remote corner where he cannot be found. If I had not submitted this complaint I would have been deeply
worried that the heavenly king and his son in their wickedness had deliberately incited his daughter to become
a spirit and cause general disaster. I beg Your Majesty in your mercy to summon the heavenly king to attend a
hearing, bring the demon under control and deliver my master. I would be deeply grateful if Your Majesty
would determine the correct penalty for this offence. This is my respectful submission."
When Pig and Friar Sand heard this they said with delight, "Brother, you're bound to win if you submit so
reasonable a complaint. Be as quick as you can. If you lose any time you may be too late to stop the evil spirit
killing our master."
"I'll hurry," said Brother Monkey, "I'll hurry. I'll be back in the time it takes to cook rice at the longest or to
make a cup of tea if I'm quick."
With one bound the splendid Great Sage carried the tablet and the incense−burner straight up by auspicious
cloud to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven, where the Heavenly Kings Powerful and Protector of the
Nation greeted him with bows, letting him in and not daring to block his way.
He went straight to the Hall of Universal Radiance, where the four heavenly teachers Zhang, Ge, Xu, and Qiu
showed him great courtesy and asked, "Why are you here, Great Sage?"
"I've got a complaint here," Monkey replied. "There are a couple of people I want to lodge a complaint
against."
"The scoundrel," thought the appalled heavenly teachers, "who can he be wanting to sue?" They had no choice
but to lead him to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and submit their report to the Jade Emperor, who ordered that
Monkey be summoned hi. Monkey then put down the tablet and the incense−burner, bowed to the emperor,
and presented his complaint. This was taken by the Ancient Immortal Ge, who spread it out on the emperor's
table. When the emperor had read it through from the beginning and learned what had happened he approved
the deposition, wrote an imperial rescript on it, and sent the Great White Planet, the Metal Planet Changgeng,
to the Cloud Tower Palace to summon the Pagoda−carrying Heavenly King Li to the imperial presence.
Monkey then stepped forward and submitted this memorial: "I beg that the Heavenly Sovereign will punish
him effectively as otherwise there will be further trouble."
"Let the complainant go too," the Jade Emperor ordered.
"What, me?" said Monkey.
"His Majesty has issued his decree," said the Four Heavenly Teachers, "so you go with the Metal Planet."
Monkey then went with the planet by cloud. They were soon at the Cloud Tower Palace, the residence of the
heavenly king. The Metal Star saw a page standing at the palace gates.
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1164
Recognizing the planet, the boy went inside to report, "The Great White Planet is here."
The heavenly king then came out to welcome the planet. Seeing that the planet was carrying a decree from the
Jade Emperor, the heavenly king ordered incense to be burned before turning round and seeing to his fury that
Monkey had come too. Why do you think he was furious? When Monkey had made great havoc in heaven all
those years earlier the Jade Emperor had appointed the heavenly king as Demon−quelling High Marshal and
Prince Nezha as Great God of the Three Altars of the Seas to lead the heavenly troops and subdue Monkey.
They had been repeatedly worsted in battle. It was resentment at this defeat five hundred years earlier that
goaded him to fury.
"Old Changgeng," he said to the planet, showing his irritation, "what kind of decree have you brought here?"
"It is a case that the Great Sage Sun has brought against you," the planet replied.
The heavenly king had been in a bad enough temper before this, but the word "case" provoked a thunderous
outburst of fury: "What case has he got against me?"
"He accuses you of masquerading as an evil spirit and kidnapping," the planet said. "Will you please burn
incense and read it for yourself."
Seething with anger, the heavenly king had an incense table set up, looked into the sky as he thanked the
emperor for his grace, made his obeisances, opened out the decree and read it through.
When he saw what it contained he thumped the incense table and exclaimed, "That ape has trumped up a pack
of lies."
"Please keep your temper," the planet replied. "A tablet and an incense−burner have been submitted to His
Majesty as evidence. He says it was your daughter who did it."
"All I have are my three sons and a single daughter," said the heavenly king. "My elder son Jinzha serves the
Tathagata Buddha as a Vanguard Guardian of the Law Dharma. My second son Moksa is a disciple of
Guanyin in the Southern Ocean. My third son Nezha stays with me as my escort at all times. My daughter
Zhenying is only six and an innocent child. She could not possibly have become an evil spirit. If you don't
believe me I'll carry her out to show you. This ape is really a disgrace. Never mind that I'm one of the most
distinguished elder statesmen in heaven and been given the authority to cut heads off before reporting to the
throne: not even an ordinary commoner in the lower world should be falsely accused. As the Legal Code says,
'the penalty for false accusation is three grades higher than the crime alleged.'"
He then ordered his underlings to fetch demon−binding rope and tie Monkey up. The Mighty Miracle God,
General Fishbelly and General Yaksha who were drawn up outside the court rushed on Monkey and tied him
up.
"Heavenly King Li," the Metal Planet pleaded, "please don't invite disaster. I have come here with him from
the imperial presence under orders from His Majesty to summon you. That rope of yours is heavy, and it
could very quickly hurt him badly or strangle him."
"Metal Star," the heavenly king replies, "there's no way I'm going to stand for his false, trumped−up charge.
Won't you take a seat while I fetch my demon−hacking sword to kill this ape with? I'll report to His Majesty
with you after I've done that." At the sight of the heavenly king fetching the sword the planet trembled with
terror.
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1165
"You've made a terrible mistake," he said to Monkey. "A case before the emperor isn't to be lightly started.
You've brought this disaster on yourself by not finding the facts out properly and you'll die for it. This is
terrible."
Monkey was completely unafraid. "Don't worry, old man," he said with a chuckle, "this is nothing. This has
always been my way of doing business: I lose out at first and win in the end."
Before the words were all out of his mouth the heavenly king's sword swung down towards Monkey's head.
But Prince Nezha was already in front of Monkey, parrying the blow with his great sword used for cutting
men in half at the waist and calling, "Please calm your temper, father."
This greatly shocked the heavenly king. Very strange! If a son used his broadsword to block his father's
cutlass he ought to be bawled out, so why did Nezha's father turn pale with shock?
Now when this son had been born to the heavenly king the word Ne was written on the palm of his left hand
and Zha on his right one, which was why he was called Nezha. When only three days old the young prince
had caused great trouble by plunging into the sea to clean himself. He had kicked the water crystal palace
down, captured a dragon and insisted on pulling its sinews out to make a belt. On learning about this, the
heavenly king had been so worried about the disastrous consequences that he had decided to kill the boy.
This had made Nezha so indignant that he had seized a sword, cut off his flesh and returned it to his mother,
then picked his bones clean and given them back to his father. Having returned his father's seed and his
mother's blood he had taken his soul straight off to the Western Paradise to appeal to the Buddha. When the
Buddha, who was expounding the sutras to all the Bodhisattvas, heard a call of "Help!" from within his
curtained and jeweled canopy he had looked with his wise eyes and seen that it was Nezha's soul. He had
made Nezha bones out of green lotus root and clothes from lotus leaves, then recited the spell to revive the
dead.
Thus it was that Nezha had come back to life. He had used his divine ability and great magical powers to
subdue ninety−six caves of demons through dharma. After this Nezha had wanted to kill his father in revenge
for having had to pick the flesh off his own bones, leaving the heavenly king with no choice but to beg the
help of the Tathagata Buddha. For the sake of harmony the Buddha had given the heavenly king an
intricately−made golden As−You−Will reliquary pagoda, in each story of which were Buddhas radiant with
splendor. The Buddha called on Nezha to regard these Buddhas as his father, thereby ending the hatred
between them. This is why Heavenly King Li is called the Pagoda−bearer. As the heavenly king was at home
off duty that day and not carrying the pagoda he was afraid that Nezha was set on revenge. This was why he
turned pale with terror.
So he turned his hand back to take the golden pagoda from its stand and hold it as he asked Nezha, "What do
you want to say to me, son? Why have you parried my sword with your broadsword?"
Throwing his broadsword down, Nezha kowtowed to his father as he replied, "Father, Your Majesty, there is a
daughter of our family in the lower world."
"My boy," the heavenly king replied, "I have only had you four children. Where could I have got another
daughter from?"
"You have forgotten, Your Majesty," Nezha replied. "The girl was once an evil spirit. Three hundred years
ago she became a monster. She stole and ate some of the Tathagata's incense, flowers and candles on Vulture
Peak, and the Tathagata sent us to capture her with heavenly soldiers. When she was caught she should have
been beaten to death, but the Tathagata said,
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1166
'Raise fish in deep water but never catch them;
Feed deer in the depths of the mountains in the hope of eternal life.'
So we spared her life. In her gratitude she bowed to you as her adoptive father, Your Majesty, and to me as
her elder brother. She set up a tablet to us in the lower world to burn incense. I never imagined she'd become
an evil spirit again and try to ruin the Tang Priest. Now Sun the Novice has trailed her to her den and brought
the tablet up here to use in a case against us before the Jade Emperor. She is your adopted daughter, not my
real sister."
This came as a terrible shock to the heavenly king. "Son," he said, "I really had forgotten. What's she called?"
"She has three names," the prince replied. Where she originally came from she was called Gold−nosed
White−haired Mouse Spirit. Then she was called Half−Bodhisattva−Guanyin because she had stolen the
incense, flowers and candles. When she was forgiven and sent down to the lower world she changed her name
again and became Lady Earth−gusher." Only then did the heavenly king come to his senses. He put his
pagoda down and started to untie Monkey himself. At this Monkey started playing it up.
"Don't you dare try to untie me!" he said. "If you want to do something you can carry me roped up as I am to
see the emperor. Then I'll win my case." The heavenly king felt weak from terror and the prince could say
nothing. Everybody fell back.
The Great Sage meanwhile was rolling about and playing it up, insisting that the heavenly king take him to
the emperor. The heavenly king could do nothing except beg the Metal Planet to put in a good word for him.
"There is an old saying," the planet replied, "that one should always be lenient. You went too far: you tied him
up and were going to kill him. The monkey is a notorious trouble−maker. How do you expect me to deal with
him? From what your worthy son has said, she is your daughter, even though adopted rather than your own,
and a child by adoption is especially dear. However one argues it you are guilty."
"Surely you can find some way of putting in a good word for me and helping me off the hook, venerable
planet," said the heavenly king.
"I would like to end the quarrel between you," the planet replied, "but I have never done him a good turn that I
can remind him of."
"Tell him how it was you who proposed that he should be amnestied and given an official post," said the
heavenly king.
The Metal Planet did then step forward, stroke Brother Monkey and say, "Great Sage, won't you let us take
the rope off before going to see the emperor, just for my sake?"
"No need to bother, old man," Monkey replied. "I'm a good roller and I can roll all the way there."
"You've got no decent feelings, you monkey," said the planet with a smile. "I did you some good turns in the
old days, but you won't do this little thing for me."
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1167
"What good turn did you ever do me?" Monkey asked.
"When you were a monster on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit you subdued tigers and dragons, forcibly
removed yourself from the register of death and assembled hordes of fiends to run wild and wreak havoc.
Heaven wanted to have you arrested. It was only because I made strong representations that an edict of
amnesty and recruitment was issued and you were summoned to Heaven to be appointed Protector of the
Horses. You drank some of the Jade Emperor's wine of immortality, and it was only because I made strong
representations again that you were given the title of Great Sage Equaling Heaven. But you refused to know
your place. You stole the peaches and the wine and robbed Lord Lao Zi of his elixir, and so it went on till you
ended up in a state of no death and no birth. If it hadn't been for me you'd never have got where you are
today."
"As the ancients put it," Monkey replied, "'Don't even share a grave with an old man when you're dead: all
he'll do is complain.' I was just a Protector of the Horses who made havoc in the heavenly palace: there was
nothing much apart from that. Oh well, never mind. I'll show you a bit of consideration as you're such an old
man. He can untie me himself." Only then did the heavenly king dare step forward, untie the rope, and ask
Brother Monkey to dress and take the seat of honour while they all took it in turn to pay their respects to him.
"Old man," Monkey said to the Metal Planet, "what about it then? I told you I lose first and win later. That's
my way of doing business. Make him hurry and see the emperor: delay could be disastrous for my master."
"Don't be impatient," the Metal Planet said. "After everything that's happened we should take a cup of tea."
"If you drink his tea, accept favours from him, take a bribe to let a criminal escape, and treat imperial edicts
with disrespect I wonder what you'll be charged with," Monkey replied.
"I won't stop for tea," the Metal Planet replied, "I won't stop for tea. You're even trying to frame me. Hurry up,
Heavenly King Li, we must be on our way." The heavenly king dared not go for fear that Monkey would
concoct some unfounded story and start playing it up: if Monkey started talking wildly he would be unable to
argue against him. So once again the heavenly king pleaded with the Metal Planet to put in a good word for
him.
"I have a suggestion to make," the planet said to Monkey. "Will you follow it?"
"I've already agreed about being tied up and hacked at," Monkey replied. "What else have you to say? Tell
me! Tell me! If it's a good idea I'll follow it; and if it isn't, don't blame me."
"'Fight a lawsuit for one day and it'll go on for ten,'" said the Metal Planet. "You brought a case before the
emperor saying that the evil spirit is the heavenly king's daughter and the heavenly king says she isn't. You
two will argue endlessly in front of His Majesty, but I tell you that a day in heaven is a year in the lower
world. In that year the evil spirit will have your master under her control in the cave, and she won't just have
married him. By then there may have been a happy event and she may have had a little baby monk. Then your
great enterprise will be ruined."
"Yes," thought Monkey, his head bowed, "when I left Pig and Friar Sand I said I'd be back in the time it takes
to cook a meal at longest and at quickest before they could make a cup of tea. I've been ages already and it
might be too late. Old man," he said aloud, "I'll take your advice. How do we obey this imperial decree?"
"Have Heavenly King Li muster his troops and go down with you to subdue the demon," the Metal Planet
replied, "while I report back to the emperor."
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1168
"What will you say?" Monkey asked.
"I'll report that the plaintiff has absconded and that the defendant is therefore excused," the planet replied.
"That's very fine," said Monkey with a grin. "I show you consideration and you accuse me of absconding. Tell
him to muster his troops and wait for me outside the Southern Gate of Heaven while you and I report back on
our mission."
"If he says anything when he's there I'll be accused of treason," exclaimed the heavenly king with terror.
"What do you take me for?" asked Monkey. "I'm a real man. Once I've given my word a team of horses
couldn't take it back. I'd never slander you."
The heavenly king thanked Monkey, who went with the Metal Planet to report back on their mission, while
the heavenly king mustered his heavenly troops and went straight to the outside of the Southern Gate of
Heaven.
When the Metal Planet and Monkey had their audience with the Jade Emperor they said, "The person who has
trapped the Tang Priest is the Golden−nosed White−haired Mouse turned spirit. She has fraudulently set up a
tablet to the heavenly king and his son. As soon as he found out, the heavenly king mustered his troops to go
and subdue the demon. We beg your Celestial Majesty to forgive him."
Once the Jade Emperor knew what had happened he dropped the prosecution in his heavenly mercy. Monkey
then went back on his cloud to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he found the heavenly king
and the prince waiting for him with their heavenly soldiers draw up on parade. The heavenly commanders met
the Great Sage amid blustering winds and seething mists, then they all took their clouds straight down to
Mount Pitfall.
Pig and Friar Sand were wide−eyed at the sight of the heavenly hosts coming down with Brother Monkey.
Greeting the heavenly king with due courtesy, the idiot said, "We have put you to great trouble in coming
here."
"You don't realize, Marshal Tian Peng," the heavenly king replied, "that it was because my son and I accepted
a joss−stick from her that the evil spirit in her wickedness captured your master. Please don't be angry with us
for being so long. Is this Mount Pitfall? Where is the entrance to the cave?"
"I know the way very well by now," said Monkey. "This cave is called the Bottomless Cave and it measures
over a hundred miles around. The evil spirit has a great many holes in it. Last time my master was held in the
gate tower with double eaves, but it's deadly quiet now. There's not even the shadow of a demon. I don't know
where she's taken him to now." To this the heavenly king replied,
"'No matter how many the tricks she may try
She'll never escape from the nets of the sky.'
We'll think of something else when we get to the cave entrance."
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1169
They all then started out, and after they had gone three or four miles they reached the great rock. "This is it,"
Monkey said pointing at the entrance that was no larger than the mouth of a large jar.
"You'll never capture the tiger's cub unless you go into the tiger's lair," observed the heavenly king. "Who
dares go in first?"
"I'll go," said Monkey.
"No, I'll go first," objected Prince Nezha. "I was the one the emperor ordered to capture the demon."
The idiot then started acting tough, shouting, "It ought to be me first."
"Stop that din," said the heavenly king. "I'll decide. The Great Sage Sun and the prince will go down with the
soldiers while we three hold the entrance. Then we'll have a coordinated action inside and outside, which will
make it impossible for her to find her way up to heaven or go further underground. That will show her a bit of
our powers."
"Yes, sir," they all said in assent.
Watch as Monkey and Prince Nezha slip into the cave at the head of their troops. As they rode their clouds
they looked around and saw that it really was a fine cave:
The pair of sun and moon as before;
A vista of rivers and hills like the other world.
Warm mists spread over pools and wells of pearl;
Much more there is to admire down here.
Crimson houses, painted halls,
Red cliffs, green fields,
Willows in the spring and lotos in the autumn;
A rare and splendid cave heaven.
An instant later they brought their clouds to a halt and went straight to the mansion where the evil spirit had
lived before. They went from gateway to gateway in their search, yelling and shouting as they went deeper
and deeper inside, trying one place after the next. All the grass for a hundred miles was trampled away. But
where was the evil spirit? Where was Sanzang?
"The wicked beast," everyone was saying, "she must have got out of this cave ages ago. She'll be far away by
now." What they did not know was that down underneath a dark corner in the Southeast of the cave there was
another, smaller cave, where behind a pair of tiny gates there was a tiny cottage with flowers growing in pots
and a few canes of bamboo beside the eaves. The atmosphere was dark and heavy with fragrance. This was
Journey to the West
Chapter 83 1170
where the evil spirit had carried Sanzang and was going to force him to marry her. She was sure that Monkey
would never find them; none of them realized that her union was fated to be thwarted.
The junior devils were jabbering away in a great crush when a bolder one among them stretched outside the
cave for a look around only for her head to butt into a heavenly soldier, who shouted, "They're here!" At this
Monkey flew into a rage, grasped the gold−banded cudgel and charged straight down in. The cave was tiny
and all the demons from the big cave were in there, so that when Prince Nezha sent his heavenly soldiers
crowding into the attack, not a single one of the demons could hide.
Monkey found the Tang Priest, the dragon horse and the baggage. The senior demon was at her wit's end. All
she could do was to kowtow to Prince Nezha, begging him to spare her life.
"We are here to arrest you at the Jade Emperor's command," Prince Nezha replied, "which is not something to
be treated lightly. My father and I were nearly in terrible trouble because of you."
He then shouted at the top of his voice, "Heavenly soldiers, fetch demon−binding rope. Tie all those evil
spirits up." The senior demon too had to suffer for a while. They all went back out of the cave together by
cloud.
Monkey was chuckling with delight when the heavenly king withdrew his guard from the mouth of the cave
and greeted Monkey with the words, "Now I can meet your master."
"Many thanks," said Monkey, "many thanks," and he led Sanzang to bow in gratitude to the heavenly king and
the prince.
Friar Sand and Pig were all for chopping the senior devil into tiny pieces, but the heavenly king said, "She
was arrested at the Jade Emperor's command, and must not be mistreated. We must go to report back on our
mission."
The heavenly king and Prince Nezha at the head of their heavenly troops and divine officers escorted the evil
spirit as a prisoner to report to the heavenly court and receive the emperor's verdict on her. Meanwhile Brother
Monkey guarded the Tang Priest while Friar Sand collected the luggage and Pig went over to the horse and
invited the master to ride. Then they all set out along their way again. Indeed:
The silken net had been cut, the golden sea dried up,
The precious lock undone, and troubles left behind.
If you do not know what lay in store for them on their way ahead listen to the explanation in the next
installment.

Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1171
The story tells how Tang Sanzang kept his masculine essence intact and escaped from the terrible snare of
mist and flowers. As he headed Westwards with Brother Monkey he did not notice that it was already
summer: warm breezes were beginning to blow, and the early summer rain was falling. It was a beautiful
sight:
Dark is the shade under tender green;
In the gentle breeze the swallows lead their young.
New lotus leaves are opening on the ponds;
Elegant bamboo is gradually reviving.
The fragrant plants join their blue to the sky;
Mountain flowers carpet all the ground.
Beside the stream the rushes are like swords;
The fiery pomegranate blossom makes the picture even more magnificent.
As the master and his three disciples traveled along enduring the heat they suddenly noticed two rows of tall
willows, from under the shade of which an old woman emerged, leaning on a small boy. "Don't go any
further, monk," she called out. "Stop your horse and go back East as soon as you can. The road West leads
nowhere."
This gave Sanzang so bad a fright that he sprang off the horse, made a gesture of greeting and said,
"Venerable Bodhisattva, in the words of the ancients,
'The sea's breadth allows the fish to leap;
The sky's emptiness lets birds fly.'
How could there possibly be no way to the West?" To this the old woman replied, pointing Westwards, "If
you go that way you will come to the capital of Dharmadestructia in a couple of miles. The king formed a
hatred of Buddhism in an earlier existence, and in his present life he is punishing it without just cause. Two
years ago he made a monstrous vow to kill ten thousand Buddhist monks. In that time he's killed 9,996
unknown monks in succession. He's just waiting for four famous monks to make up his ten thousand so that
he will fulfil the vow. If you go into the city you will be throwing away your lives for nothing."
At the sound of this Sanzang was so terrified that he shivered and shook as he replied, "Venerable
Bodhisattva, I am deeply moved by your great kindness and infinitely grateful too. But, tell me, is there a
suitable way I could take that does not go into the city?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1172
"There's no way round," the old woman replied with a laugh, "no way round. The only way you'll get past it is
if you can fly."
At this Pig started shooting his mouth off from where he stood beside them: "Don't try to put us off. We can
all fly."
Monkey's fiery eyes with their golden pupils really could distinguish good from evil, and he saw that the old
woman and the little boy on whom she was leaning were in fact the Bodhisattva Guanyin and the page
Sudhana. He hastily flung himself to the ground and began to kowtow, calling out, "Bodhisattva, your disciple
failed to welcome you. I'm sorry."
The Bodhisattva then rose slowly on her multicolored cloud, so startling the venerable elder that his legs gave
way under him and he kowtowed as he knelt there for all he was worth. Pig and Friar Sand also fell to their
knees in alarm and kowtowed to heaven. A moment later she was heading straight back to the Southern Sea
amid auspicious clouds.
Monkey then got up and supported his master as he said, "Get up please. The Bodhisattva's already gone back
to her island."
"Wukong," Sanzang said, "if you knew she was the Bodhisattva why did you not say so before?"
"You ask too many questions," Monkey replied with a grin. "When I started kowtowing wasn't that early
enough?"
"It was lucky the Bodhisattva told us that Dharmadestructia, where they kill monks, is ahead of us," Pig and
Friar Sand said to Monkey. "Whatever are we to do?"
"Don't be afraid, idiot," Monkey replied. "We've come to no harm from any of the vicious demons and evil
monsters we've met already or in the tigers' dens and dragons' pools we've been in. This is just a country of
ordinary people. What's there to be so scared of? The only thing is that we can't stay here. It's getting late in
the day and some of the villagers are coming back from market in the town. It will be no good if they see
we're monks and raise a hue and cry. We'd better take the master away from the main road to some quiet and
secluded spot where we can discuss things." Sanzang accepted Monkey's suggestion and they slipped away
from the main road to a hollow in the ground where they sat down.
"Brother," said Monkey, "you two look after the master while I turn myself into something and go into town
to take a look around. I'll find a side road that we can get away along tonight."
"Disciple," said Sanzang, "don't take this lightly. The royal law is implacable. You must be careful."
"Don't worry," said Monkey with a smile, "don't worry. I can cope."
This said, the Great Sage leapt whistling up into the air. It was very strange:
No rope to hold on to above,
No pole to support him below.
Others are all like their parents,
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1173
But the weight of his bones was low.
As he stood in the clouds looking down he saw that the city was full of the most happy and auspicious
atmosphere. "What a splendid place," Monkey said. "Why are they trying to destroy the Dharma here?" He
looked around for a while, and in the gathering dusk he saw:
Bright lights at the crossroads,
Incense and bells in the ninefold hall.
The seven brightest stars shone in the blue heavens,
And the travelers stopped moving in all eight directions.
From the army barracks
The painted bugle could just be heard;
In the drum tower
The copper water−clock began to drip.
All around the evening mists were dense;
Cold fog was thick in the markets.
Two by two the couples went to their beds
As the bright moon's disk was rising in the East.
"If I went down into the streets to look for our way with a face like this," he thought, "anyone I saw would be
sure I was a monk. I'd better change." He made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook himself
and turned into a moth, the sort that flies into the lantern:
A tiny body, a pair of delicate wings,
Who puts out the lamp and flies into the candle when seeking the light.
Formed by changing its own original body,
It makes its magic response in grass that's decaying.
Loving the burning light of the candle's flame,
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1174
Endlessly flying around it with never a pause,
The purple−clad moth with its scented wings drives off the fireflies;
What it likes best is the windless calm of the night.
Watch him as he flutters and flies straight to the main streets and the markets, keeping close to the eaves and
the corners of the buildings he passes. As he was flying along he noticed an angled row of houses on a corner
with a lantern hanging above each doorway.
"They must be celebrating the Lantern Festival here," he thought. "Why else is that line of lighted lanterns
there?" Stiffening his wings and flying up for a closer look, he saw that on a square lantern outside the middle
house was written, "Accommodation for Commercial Travelers," with "Wang the Second's Inn" beneath it.
Only then did Monkey realize that this was an inn. Stretching his head forward for a closer look he saw eight
or nine men inside who had all eaten their supper, taken off their clothes and hats, washed their hands and feet
and gone to bed.
"The master will get through," Monkey thought with secret delight. How did he know that? Because he was
having a wicked idea: he would wait till they were all asleep, then steal their clothes and hats so that he and
his companions could go into the city dressed as laymen.
Oh dear! This was one of those things that don't turn out as you want them to. While Monkey was still
thinking about his plan Wang the Second went up to the merchants and said, "Please be vigilant, gentlemen.
We have villains here as well as decent people. You must all be careful about your clothes and luggage."
As you can imagine, the travelling merchants were all very vigilant, and the innkeeper's advice made them
more cautious than ever. So they all got out of bed and said, "You're quite right, host. We travelers have a
hard time. We're always worried that if there's some emergency when we're asleep we may not wake up; and
if things go wrong we're in a mess. You'd better take all our clothes, hats and bags and look after them for us
inside. Tomorrow morning you can give them back to us when we get up."
Wang the Second then took all the clothes he could find into his own room. Monkey anxiously spread his
wings, flew in there and landed on the hat stand, from where he saw Wang the Second take the lantern down
from the door, lower the blinds, and shut the door and window. Only then did he go into his bedroom, undress
and lie down.
Now Wang the Second had a wife and two children who were crying and making a noise, in no hurry to sleep.
Wang's wife then started mending a torn piece of clothing, so that she too was still awake. "If I have to wait
till that woman stops working and goes to sleep," thought Monkey, "I'll be keeping the master waiting too."
He then started worrying that if he left it till much later the city gates would be shut, so he lost patience and
flew down into the flame of the lamp. It was indeed a case of
He was ready to die when he dived at the blaze,
And with brows scarred by fire to live out his days.
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1175
Having extinguished the lamp he shook himself and turned into a rat who gave a couple of squeaks, jumped
down, grabbed hats and clothes and went outside. "Old man," the woman said with alarm, "this is terrible. A
rat's turned into a spirit."
When Monkey heard this he used another trick, blocking the doorway and yelling at the top of his voice,
"That woman's talking nonsense, Wang the Second. Ignore her. I'm not a rat turned spirit. As a decent man I
don't do underhanded things. I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven come down to earth to protect the Tang
Priest while he goes to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I've come to borrow these clothes as a
disguise for my master because your king is so wicked. I'll bring them back soon when we're out of the city."
Once Wang the Second heard this he scrambled out of bed and started groping around the floor in the dark.
He was in such a rush that when he got hold of his trousers he thought they were his shirt: there was no way
he could put them on no matter how he tried.
By now the Great Sage had used lifting magic to escape on his cloud, which he turned round to go straight
back to the hollow by the road. Sanzang was looking out for him fixedly by the bright light of the moon and
the stars, and as soon as he saw Monkey approaching he called out, "Can we get through the capital of
Dharmadestructia, disciple?"
Coming up and laying the clothes down in front of him, Monkey replied, "Master, you won't get through
Dharmadestructia as a monk."
"Brother," said Pig, "who do you think you're making things hard for? It's easy to stop being a monk. All you
have to do is stop shaving your head for six months and let your hair grow."
"We can't wait six months," Monkey replied. "We're going to turn into laymen right now."
"But that's a completely ridiculous thing to say," said a shocked Pig. "We're all monks now, and if we turned
into laymen straight away we wouldn't be able to wear hats. Even if we could pull them tight enough at the
edges we've got no hair to tie the string at the top to."
"Stop fooling about," Sanzang shouted, "and be serious. What do you really have in mind?"
"I've had a good look at this city, Master," Monkey replied, "and although the king is a wicked one who kills
monks he is a true son of heaven. There is an auspicious glow and a happy atmosphere above the city. I know
my way round the streets now, and I can understand and talk the local language. I've just borrowed these hats
and clothes from an inn for us to dress ourselves up as laymen in. We'll go into the city, put up for the night,
get up at the fourth watch and ask the innkeeper to fix us some vegetarian food. At the fifth watch we'll go out
through the gate and head West along the main road. If we meet anyone who tries to stop us we can talk our
way out of it. I'll tell him we were sent by the ruler of their suzerain state. The king of Dharmadestructia won't
dare hold us up. He'll let us go on our way."
"Our big brother has arranged things very well," said Friar Sand. "Let's do as he suggests."
The venerable elder did indeed have no option but to take off his monastic tunic and hat and put on a layman's
clothing and headwear. Friar Sand changed too, but Pig's head was too big for him to be able to wear a hat.
Monkey fetched needle and thread, tore two hats open and sewed them into a single one. Then he put the hat
on Pig's head and found a garment big enough for him to wear. Finally he dressed himself and said,
"Gentlemen, we must ban the words 'master' and 'disciples' on this journey."
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1176
"What else can we call each other?" Pig asked. "We must talk like people who address each other as brothers,"
Monkey replied. "The master can call himself Tang the Eldest. You can be Hogg the Third, and Friar Sand
can be Sand the Fourth. I'll be Sun the Second. But when we are in the inn none of you must say anything.
Leave all the talking to me. When they ask what line of business we're in I'll say we're horse dealers. I'll
pretend that the white horse is a sample and that there are ten of us altogether, of whom we four have come
ahead to book rooms at an inn and sell this horse. The innkeeper will be bound to treat us well then. We'll be
properly looked after, and before we leave I'll find a piece of broken tile and turn it into silver to pay him
with. Then we'll be able to go on our way." Although he was not happy about it the Tang Priest had to go
along with this.
The four of them hurried to the city, leading the horse and carrying the luggage. As this was a very peaceful
place the city gates were still open although it was already night. They went straight into the city, and as they
passed the gateway of Wang the Second's inn they could hear shouting inside.
People were yelling, "My hat's disappeared!" and "My clothes have gone!" Pretending he did not know what
this was all about, Monkey took them to an inn further along on the other side of the road. This inn was still
showing its lantern, so Monkey went up to the gateway and called, "Do you have a vacant room for us,
innkeeper?"
"Yes, yes," a woman answered from inside. "Please come upstairs, gentlemen." Before she had finished
speaking a man came out to take the horse. Monkey handed him the horse to take inside. He then led the
master into the building in the shadow of the lamp. Upstairs there were tables and chairs conveniently
arranged, and when the window was opened they all sat down in the clear moonlight.
When someone came with a lighted lamp Monkey blocked the doorway, blew it out and said, "No need for a
lamp on a bright night like this."
No sooner had the man with the lamp gone down than a maid came up with four bowls of tea. Monkey took
the bowls from her, only for her to be followed by a woman who looked to be about fifty−six or fifty−seven
coming up the stairs.
Standing beside Monkey she asked, "Where are you gentlemen from? What fine goods do you have?"
"We're from the North," Monkey replied, "and we've got a few poor horses to sell."
"You're very young to be a horse dealer," the woman said.
"This gentleman is Tang the Eldest," Monkey explained, "this is Hogg the Third, and this is Sand the fourth.
I'm Sun the Second, an apprentice."
"But your surnames are all different," said the woman with a smile. "Yes," Monkey replied, "our surnames are
different but we all live together. There are ten of us brothers altogether, and we four have come ahead to fix
our board and lodging. The other six have found a place outside the city to stay tonight. It would have been
awkward for them to come into the city as they've got a herd of horses. They'll come in tomorrow morning
when we've fixed some accommodation. We won't go home till we've sold the horses."
"How many horses are there in your herd?" the woman asked.
"Over a hundred of all ages," Monkey replied. "They're all like that one of ours, except that they come in
different colours."
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1177
"Mr. Sun," the woman said with a laugh, "you really know how to travel. You should have come straight here:
no other inn would be able to put you up. We have a big courtyard well supplied with troughs and tethering
posts and plenty of fodder too. We could feed several hundred horses here. There's just one thing I should
mention. I've been keeping this inn for many years and it's quite well known. My late husband was called
Zhao, but I'm afraid he died long ago, so this is now called Widow Zhao's Inn. We have three classes of
entertainment for our guests. Let's get sordid money matters out of the way, then we can be more civilized
later. The first thing is to discuss the tariffs and agree on one so that we know where we stand when it's time
to settle the accounts."
"Quite right," Monkey replied. "What are your three classes of entertainment? As the saying goes,
Your tariffs may be low, your tariffs may be dear,
But treat us all the same, who come from far or near.
What do your tariffs involve? Could you explain them to me?"
"We have first, second and third−class tariffs," the old woman replied. "The first class is a banquet with five
kinds of fruit and five different dishes. The tables are set with confectionery lions and immortals fighting.
Two gentlemen share a table, and there are young ladies to sing to them and sleep with them. It costs half an
ounce of silver per head, the price of the room included."
"I'd agree to that," Monkey replied. "Where we come from half an ounce wouldn't even pay for a girl."
"For the second−class tariff," the woman continued, "you all eat from the same dishes of food and we provide
fruit and warm wine that you help yourselves to in your drinking games. No young ladies are provided and it
costs one fifth of an ounce of silver each."
"I'd agree to that too," Monkey replied. "What about the third class?"
"I wouldn't like to discuss it with such distinguished gentlemen as yourselves," she replied.
"No harm in telling us about it," Monkey replied, "so that we can choose what suits us best."
"Nobody waits on you in the third class," she said, "and we provide a big pot of rice for you to eat from as you
will. When you're full there's straw for you to spread out on the ground and sleep on where it suits you. At
dawn you give us a few coppers for the rice and I can assure you we won't argue about how much."
"We're in luck," said Pig, "we're in luck. That's the sort of deal I like. I'll eat my fill from the cauldron then
have a bloody good sleep in front of the stove."
"What nonsense, brother," said Monkey. "We've earned an ounce or two of silver on our travels. Give us the
first−class treatment."
"Make some good tea," the woman said with great delight, "and tell the kitchen to get the food ready quickly."
She then went downstairs calling out, "Kill chickens and geese and boil up some pickled meat for them to
have with their rice."
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1178
Then she shouted, "Kill a pig and a sheep. What can't be eaten today can be served tomorrow. Get some good
wine. Use the best white rice, and make some pancakes with white flour."
When Sanzang heard all this from upstairs he said, "Whatever shall we do, Sun the Second? They're going to
slaughter chickens, geese, a pig and a sheep. If they bring us all these we won't be able to eat them as we're all
vegetarians."
"I've got an idea," said Monkey, and he stamped in the doorway and called out, "Mrs. Zhao, come up here."
"What instructions do you have for me, sir," she asked.
"Don't kill any living creatures today. We're eating vegetarian food today," Monkey replied.
"Are you gentlemen permanent vegetarians, or just vegetarians for this month?" asked the woman in surprise.
"Neither," replied Monkey. "We're vegetarians on gengshen days. Today's one, so we have to eat meatless
food. But after the third watch tonight it'll be a xinyou day and the restrictions won't apply. Kill them
tomorrow. Lay on some vegetarian food today, and make it first−class."
This made the woman happier than ever. "Don't slaughter anything," she said, hurrying downstairs, "don't
slaughter anything. Fetch some tree−ear fungus, Fujian bamboo shoots, beancurd and wheat gluten. Pick some
green vegetables in the garden, make vermicelli soup, steam some brad rolls, boil more white rice and make
some scented tea."
Now the cooks were experts because they cooked every day, so that everything was ready in an instant to be
set out upstairs. They also had some confectioneries of lions and immortals that were already made for the
four travelers to eat their fill of.
When the question was asked, "Would you like some mild wine?" Brother Monkey replied, "Eldest Brother
Tang won't have any, but the rest of us will have a few cups." The widow then fetched a jug of warm wine.
When drinks had been poured out for the three of them they heard the sound of banging against wooden
boards. "Has some furniture fallen over downstairs, missus?" Monkey asked.
"No," the woman replied, "It's some retainers from my farm who arrived late this evening with rent rice. We
let them sleep downstairs. As we were short−staffed when you gentlemen arrived I told them to take the
sedan−chairs to the brothel to fetch some young ladies to keep you company. They must have hit the
underneath of the floorboards with the chair−poles."
"You mentioned that before," Monkey said. "But don't send for them now. Today's a fast day, and besides, our
brothers aren't here yet. They'll be here tomorrow for sure. Then we can all send for some call−girls and have
a good time in your excellent establishment before we sell our horses and go."
"What good men," the woman said, "what good men. That way you'll all stay friends and you won't waste
your energy." Then she ordered that the sedan−chairs be brought back in as the whores were not to be fetched.
The four of them finished their wine and food, the utensils were cleared away, and the meal was over.
"Where are we going to sleep?" Sanzang whispered in Monkey's ear.
"Upstairs," Monkey replied.
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1179
"Too dangerous," Sanzang replied. "We have all had so hard a journey that we may well fall fast asleep. If any
of the inn people come in to tidy up and our hats have rolled off they will see our bald heads, realize that we
are monks, and raise a hue and cry. That would be a disaster."
"You're right," said Monkey, going out to stamp his foot again.
"What instructions do you have this time, Mr. Sun?" the woman asked, coming upstairs once more.
"Where are we to sleep?" Monkey asked.
"Upstairs is best," she replied. "There are no mosquitoes and there's a South wind. Open the windows wide
and you'll sleep beautifully."
"We won't be able to," said Monkey. "Our Mr. Hogg the Third has a touch of gout, Mr. Sand the Fourth has
some rheumatism in his shoulder, Brother Tang can only sleep in the dark, and I don't like the light myself. So
this is no place for us to sleep."
As the woman went downstairs, leaning on the banisters and sighing, her daughter, who was carrying a child
in her arms, came up to her and said, "Mother, as the saying goes, 'Be stuck on a sandbank for ten days, then
said past nine sandbanks in one.' It's too hot now to be doing much business, but once autumn begins we'll
have more than we can handle. What are you sighing like that for?"
"It's not because business is slack, daughter," the older woman replied. "I was just going to close the inn up
this evening when four horse dealers came and took a room. They wanted the first−class tariff. I was hoping
to make a little silver out of them, and I'm sighing because we won't earn much: they're fasting."
"As they've already eaten they can't very well go to another inn," the daughter replied. "And we'll be able to
make money out of them when we serve them meat and wine tomorrow."
"They're all poorly," the older woman replied, "and want somewhere dark to sleep because they don't like
drafts or light. All the rooms in the inn have got missing tiles, so where am I going to find somewhere dark for
them? It'd be best to write off the cost of the meal and tell them to stay somewhere else."
"But we do have somewhere dark in the house, mother," her daughter replied, "where there's no draft and no
light. It'll do splendidly."
"Where?" the older woman asked.
"The big trunk that father had made when he was still alive," the daughter replied. "It's four feet wide, seven
feet long and three feet high, and big enough for seven people to sleep in. Tell them to sleep in the trunk."
"I don't know whether it'll do," said the older woman. "I'll ask them. Mr. Sun, if you won't have our poky little
room there's nowhere darker here than our big trunk. It'll keep out light and drafts. So why don't you sleep in
the trunk?"
"Splendid," Monkey replied. She then told several of the retainers to carry the trunk out and open the lid,
while inviting her guests to come downstairs. Monkey led the master and Friar Sand carried the luggage as
they went to the trunk, following in the lantern's shadow. The reckless Pig was the first to climb inside. Friar
Sand lifted the luggage in then helped the Tang Priest in before getting in himself.
"Where's our horse?" Monkey asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1180
"Tied up eating hay in the stables at the back," replied the servant who was attending them.
"Bring it here," said Monkey, "and bring the trough too. Tether the animal next to the trunk." Only then did he
get inside himself and call out, "Shut the lid, Mrs. Zhao, fasten the hasp and padlock it. And look it over for
us. Glue paper wherever it lets in the light. Open it again early tomorrow morning."
"You're very particular," the widow said. After that the doors were fastened and everyone went to bed.
The story switches to the four of them in the chest. Poor things! They were wearing hats, the weather was very
hot and it was airless and stuffy. They took off their hats and clothes, and fanned themselves with their
monastic hats for lack of fans. They were all crowded in next to each other and did not fall asleep till the
second watch. Monkey, however, wanted to make trouble, so he stayed awake. He put his hand out and gave
Pig a pinch on the leg.
The idiot pulled his leg in and mumbled, "Go to sleep. We've had a hard day. What do you want to fool
around pinching people's hands and feet for?"
"We started by laying out five thousand ounces of silver," said Monkey aloud, deliberately making mischief,
"and we sold those horses the other day for three thousand. We've got four thousand in the two bags, and we'll
sell this herd of horses for another three thousand. That means we'll have doubled our capital. That's not bad."
Pig, who was sleepy, did not bother to reply.
Now the floor staff, the water−carriers and the kitchen porters were in league with bandits. After hearing
Brother Monkey talking about all the money they had, several of them slipped off to fetch twenty or more
armed bandits to come with torches to rob the four horse traders. As they charger in through the gates they
gave Widow Zhao and her daughter such a fright that shivering and shaking they fastened the doors of their
room and let the robbers take whatever they wanted outside. Now the bandits were not after the inn's property
but were looking for the guests. When they went upstairs and found no sign of them there, they lit their
torches and held them out while they looked all around. All they could see was a large trunk in the courtyard,
to the bottom of which was tethered a white horse. The lid was tightly locked and could not be prized open.
"Travelling merchants all know what they're about," the bandits said. "This trunk looks so strong that it's
bound to be full of purses, valuables and silk. Let's steal the horse, take the trunk out of town, open it up and
share out what's inside. That would be the best thing, wouldn't it?" The bandits then found some rope with
which they lifted the box and carried it off, swinging and swaying.
"Brother," said Pig, woken up by this, "go to sleep. Why are you rocking us?"
"Shut up," Monkey replied. "Nobody's rocking us."
Sanzang and Friar Sand had been abruptly awoken too, and they asked, "Who's carrying us?"
"Keep quiet," said Monkey, "keep quiet. Let them carry us. If they carry us to the Western Heaven we'll be
saved the trouble of walking."
But the successful bandits were not heading West. Instead they headed towards the East of the city, killing the
soldiers on the city gate, opening it and letting themselves out. This caused a sensation in the streets and the
markets, where the watchmen of all the shops reported it to the commander−in−chief of the city garrison and
the East city commissioner. As this was their responsibility the commander−in−chief and the East city
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1181
commissioner mustered a force of infantry, cavalry and bowmen that left the city in pursuit of the bandits.
Seeing that resistance to so powerful a government force would have been pointless, the bandits abandoned
the trunk and the white horse, scattered into the undergrowth and disappeared. The government troops did not
catch even half a robber: all they captured was the trunk and the white horse, with which they returned in
triumph. The commander−in−chief examined the horse in the light of the lamps and saw that it was a fine one:
Threads of silver grew in his mane;
In his tail hung strands of jade.
Forget about Eight Chargers and dragon steeds;
This was steadier than the great Sushuang;
Its bones alone would have sold for a thousand ounces of silver;
It could gallop after the wind for three thousand miles.
When it climbed a mountain it merged into the clouds;
As it neighed at the moon it was as white as snow.
It was truly a dragon from an ocean island,
A unicorn of Jade in the human world.
The commander−in−chief rode the white horse instead of his own steed as he led his men back into the city.
The trunk was carried to his headquarters, where he and the East city commissioner sealed it with strips of
paper on which they wrote and set a guard over it till morning, when they would submit a memorial to the
king and request a decision on what to do with it. After that the other troops were dismissed.
The story now tells how the venerable Tang Priest was grumbling at Monkey inside the chest. "Ape," he said,
"you've killed me this time. If I had been arrested outside and taken to the king of Dharmadestructia I might
well have been able to put up a good argument in my defense. But now I am here, locked in this trunk. I have
been carried off by bandits and recaptured by the army. When we are shown to the king tomorrow we will be
all ready for him to put to the sword and make up his ten thousand."
"There are people outside!" exclaimed Monkey. "If they open the trunk and take you out you'll either be tied
up or hung up. If you don't want to be tied or strung up you'd better show a little patience. When we're taken
to see this deluded king tomorrow I'll definitely be able to talk my way out of things. I guarantee that not one
hair of yours will be harmed. So stop worrying and go back to sleep."
In the third watch Monkey used one of his magic powers. Slipping his cudgel out he blew on it with a magic
breath, called "Change!" and turned it into a triple auger with which he drilled two or three holes near the
bottom of the chest, forming a single larger hole. He put the auger away, shook himself, turned into an ant and
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1182
crawled out. Then he turned back into himself and rode his cloud straight to the palace gates. The king was
fast asleep at the time, so Monkey used his Great All powerful Body−dividing Magic.
Plucking all the hairs out of his left arm he blew on them with a magic breath, called "Change!" and turned
them into little Monkeys. Then he pulled all the hairs out from his right arm, blew on them with a magic
breath, called "Change!" and turned them into sleep−insects. Next he recited the magic word Om and told the
local deity of the place to take the little Monkeys to distribute them throughout the palace to all the officials in
every office and department of government. Each holder of official rank was given a sleep−insect to ensure
that he or she would sleep soundly and not get up. Monkey then took his gold−banded cudgel in his hands,
squeezed it, waved it, called, "Change, treasure!" and turned it into over a thousand razors of the sort used for
shaving the head. Taking one himself, he told all the little monkeys to take one each and shave the heads of
everyone in the inner quarters of the palace and in all the government departments and offices. This was
indeed a case of:
When the Dharma king would destroy it the Dharma is infinite;
The Dharma runs through heaven and earth, opening the Great Way.
The origins of ten thousand Dharmas all come down to one;
The features of the Three Vehicles are basically the same.
He bored through the trunk to find out the news,
Distributed his golden hairs to smash delusion,
Determined to bring the Dharma king to the true achievement,
To the eternal emptiness of what is not born and dies not.
That night the head−shaving was completed, so Monkey said another spell to dismiss the local deity, shook
himself to bring all the hairs back to his arms, then touched all the razors to turn them back into their true
form as the gold−banded cudgel, which he made much smaller and hid in his ear again. Finally he reverted to
being an ant, crawled back into the trunk, and went on guarding the Tang Priest in his time of danger.
When the palace ladies in the inner quarters got up to wash and do their hair before dawn the next morning
they all found that their hair had gone. The same had happened to all the eunuchs, senior and junior, who
moved around the palace. They all crowded to the outside of the royal bedchamber, where they played music
to wake the king up, all holding back their tears but not daring to speak. Before long the queen in the palace
woke up to find her hair gone too. When she hurried with lanterns to the dragon bed she found a monk
sleeping in the brocade quilt, at which she could restrain her tongue no longer, thus awakening the king.
When the king suddenly opened his eyes wide and saw the queen's bald head he got straight out of bed and
said, "Why are you like that, my queen?"
"You're the same, Your Majesty," she replied. The king then rubbed his head, which gave him such a fright
that the three souls in his body groaned, and his seven spirits flew off into the air.
Journey to the West
Chapter 84 1183
"What has happened to me?" he exclaimed.
Just when he was in this panicky state the royal consorts, the palace ladies and the eunuchs young and old all
fell to their knees, their heads shaved bald, and said, "Lord, we have all been turned into monks."
At the sight of them the king wept. "We think this must be because of all the monks we have killed," he said.
He then gave these orders: "None of you are to say anything about the loss of our hair as, if you do, the civil
and military officials may slander our country and say that it has been badly governed. Let us now hold court
in the throne hall."
Now all the officials high and low in all the departments and offices of government went to court to pay their
respects before dawn. As it turned out, all these men had lost their hair in the night too, and they all submitted
memorials reporting the fact. All that could be heard was:
The whip of silence sounding three times at the royal audience;
As all report that their heads have now been shaved.
If you do not know what happened to the booty in the trunk that the commander−in−chief had recaptured and
whether the Tang Priest and his three disciples were to live or die, listen to the explanation in the next
installment.
Chapter 85
The Mind−ape is jealous of the Mother of Wood
The Demon Chief Plots to Devour the Master of Dhyana
The story tells how when the king held his dawn audience the civil and military officials all carried
memorials. "Sovereign Lord," they reported, "we beg you to forgive your servants for their lack of decorum."
"Gentlemen," the king replied, "you are all as courteous as ever. What lack of decorum are you showing?"
"Sovereign Lord," they said, "we do not know why, but all of your servants lost their hair last night." Holding
in his hand these memorials about the lost hair, the king descended from his dragon throne to say to the
officials, "Indeed, we do not know why either, but everyone in the palace, young and old, lost their hair last
night."
King and ministers alike all wept as they said, "From now on we will not dare kill any more monks." The king
then returned to his throne and the officials took their places in their proper ranks. The king then said, "Let
those with business here come forward from their ranks to report. If there is no other business the curtain may
be rolled up and the audience ended."
The commander−in−chief of the capital's garrison then moved forward from the ranks of military officials and
the East city commissioner moved forward from the ranks of the civil officials to kowtow at the steps of the
throne and report, "We were patrolling the city on Your Majesty's orders last night when we recaptured a
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1184
trunk of bandits' booty and a white horse. As we do not dare take unauthorized action over these we beg Your
Majesty to issue an edict." The king was delighted.
"Bring it here, trunk and all," he ordered.
The two officials then returned to their own offices, mustered a full complement of soldiers and had the trunk
carried out. Sanzang, who was inside, felt his soul leaving his body. "Disciples," he said, "what shall we say in
our defense when we reach the king?"
"Shut up," said Monkey with a grin. "I've fixed everything. When the trunk's opened the king will bow to us
as his teachers. The only thing is that Pig mustn't quarrel about precedence."
"If they don't kill me that'll be heaven," Pig replied. "What would I want to quarrel about?" Before these
words were all out of his mouth they had been carried to the palace entrance and in through the Tower of Five
Phoenixes to be set at the foot of the steps to the throne.
On being invited by the two officials to have the trunk opened and look inside the king ordered that this be
done. No sooner was the lid lifted than Pig, who could restrain himself no longer, sprang outside, giving all
the officials such a fright that they shivered, unable to speak. Next Brother Monkey could be seen helping the
Tang Priest out, while Friar Sand lifted the luggage out.
Seeing that the commander−in−chief was holding the white horse, Pig went up to him, made an angry noise
and said, "That's my horse. Hand it over!" This so terrified the official that he collapsed head over heels.
The four pilgrims all stood upright in the middle of the steps, and when the king saw that they were monks he
came down at once from his dragon throne, sent for his queen and consorts from the inner quarters, descended
the steps of the throne hall, bowed to them along with all his officials and asked, "What brings you venerable
gentlemen here?"
"I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor to go to the Great Thunder Monastery in India in
the West to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true scriptures," Sanzang replied.
"Venerable Master," the king said, "you have come from far away. But why did you sleep in this trunk last
night?"
"I knew that Your Majesty had sworn a vow to kill Buddhist monks," Sanzang replied, "which is why I did
not dare to visit your illustrious country openly, but disguised myself as a layman to arrive late at night to find
lodging in one of your inns. We slept in the trunk because we were afraid that our real identity would be
d i s c o v e r e d . U n f o r t u n a t e l y t h e t r u n k w a s s t o l e n b y b a n d i t s , t h e n b r o u g h t b a c k h e r e b y t h e
commander−in−chief. Now that I have been able to see Your Majesty's dragon countenance, the clouds have
cleared away and the sun has come out. I hope that Your Majesty will pardon and release me, ascetic monk
that I am: my gratitude will be as deep as the ocean."
"Venerable Master," the king replied, "you are a distinguished monk from our suzerain heavenly dynasty. It
was wrong of us not to go out to welcome you. For years we have been fulfilling a vow to kill monks because
a monk once maligned us. The vow we made to heaven was to kill ten thousand monks to make up a round
number. We never imagined that today we would return to the truth and that we would all be turned into
monks. Now all of us, king, officials, queen and consorts, have had our hair shaved off. I beg, Venerable
Master, that you will not be grudging with your lofty virtue and will take us as your disciples."
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1185
When Pig heard this he started roaring with laughter: "If you're going to be our disciples what introductory
presents have you got for us?"
"If you will accept us as your follower, Master," the king replied, "we will present you with all the wealth in
our kingdom."
"Don't talk about wealth to us," said Brother Monkey, "as we're proper monks. As long as you inspect and
return our passport and escort us out of the city I can guarantee that your monarchy will last for ever and that
you will enjoy a long and happy life." On hearing this the king ordered his office of foreign relations to
arrange a great feast at which monarch and officials together returned to the one truth. The passport was
immediately inspected and returned, after which Sanzang was asked to change the name of the country.
"'Dharma' in the name of Your Majesty's country is excellent," Monkey said, "but the 'destructia' part is
nonsense. Now that we've come here you should change the name to 'Dharmarespectia'. This would guarantee
Clear waters and victory for a thousand generations;
Timely winds and rain with universal peace."
The king thanked them for their gracious kindness, had the royal carriage prepared and escorted the Tang
Priest and his three disciples Westwards out of the city.
We will say no more of how monarch and subjects now held to the true faith, but tell how after leaving the
king of Dharmarespectia the venerable elder said happily from on his horse, "What excellent magic you used,
Wukong. It worked very well."
"Elder brother," said Friar Sand, "where did you find so many barbers to shave all those heads in one night?"
Monkey then told them all about how he had used his miraculous powers, at which they all laughed so much
they could not stop.
Just as they were feeling so cheerful a great mountain came into view, blocking their way. Reining in the
horse, the Tang Priest said, "Disciples, see how high that mountain is. You must be very careful."
"Don't worry," said Monkey with a grin, "don't worry. I promise you nothing will go wrong."
"Don't say that," Sanzang replied. "I can see those jutting peaks, and even from a distance it looks rather
sinister. Storm clouds are streaming from it, and I am beginning to feel frightened. My whole body is turning
numb and my spirits are disturbed."
"You have already forgotten the Heart Sutra that the Rook's Nest Hermit taught you," said Brother Monkey.
"I can still remember it," Sanzang said.
"Even if you can still remember that," said Monkey, "there is a quatrain that you've forgotten."
"What quatrain?" Sanzang asked, to which Monkey replied,
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1186
"Do not go far to seek the Buddha on Vulture Peak;
Vulture Peak is in your heart.
Everybody has a Vulture Peak stupa
Under which to cultivate conduct."
"Of course I know it, disciple," said Sanzang. "According to that quatrain the thousands of scriptures all come
down to cultivating the heart."
"Goes without saying," Monkey replied.
"When the heart is purified it can shine alone;
When the heart is preserved all perceptions are pure.
If there is any mistake then laziness follows,
And success will not come in a myriad years.
As long as your will is sincere Thunder Peak is before your eyes.
But if you're as scared, frightened and disturbed as this the Great Way is distant, and Thunder Peak is far, far
away. Forget those wild fears and come with me." When the venerable elder heard this his spirits were
revived and his worries disappeared.
The four of them had only gone a few more steps when they reached the mountain. When they raised their
eyes this was what they saw:
A fine mountain,
Dappled with many colours.
White clouds drifted around the peak,
And cool were the shadows of the trees in front of the cliff.
The birds rustled in the leaves,
The beasts were ferocious.
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1187
Among the woods were a thousand pines,
On the ridge a few bamboos.
Howls came from gray wolves seizing their prey,
And roars from hungry tigers fighting over food.
Long screamed the wild apes searching for fruit;
The David's−deer climbed through blossoms into mists of green.
The wind was blowing,
The waters babbled,
And hidden birds sang in the deserted pass.
Here and there wisteria was climbing
While rare flowers bloomed by the stream amid orchids.
Intricately shaped and strange were the rocks,
And sheer rose the crags.
Foxes and raccoon−dogs ran in packs;
Badgers and apes were playing in groups.
The travelers were worried by so high and steep a mountain:
Why was the ancient track so twisted?
While master and disciples were moving timidly ahead they heard the howling of a wind. "There's a wind,"
said Sanzang in fear.
"In the spring there are mild winds," Monkey replied, "in the summer hot ones, in the autumn golden ones and
in the winter North winds. There are winds in all four seasons. What's so frightening about a wind?"
"This wind is blowing very hard," Sanzang replied. "It is definitely not a wind from heaven."
"But winds always come from the earth and clouds from mountains," Monkey replied, "so how could there be
a wind from heaven?" Before he had finished speaking a mist arose. That mist really was
Darkness joining up with the sky,
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1188
Obscurity making the whole earth dim.
The sun had completely vanished from sight
And no bird sang.
All was as indistinct as primal chaos,
And the air seemed filled with flying dust.
The trees on the mountain could not be seen
Where had the herb−gatherers gone?
"Wukong," said Sanzang in fright, "why is there this mist when the wind is still blowing?"
"Don't get upset," Monkey replied. "Get off your horse, Master. I'll go and see whether or not it's sinister
while you two keep guard, brothers."
The splendid Great Sage needed only to bow in order to be in mid−air. Holding his hand to his brow for
shade, he opened his fiery eyes wide and looked down to see an evil spirit sitting at the foot of a beetling scar.
Just look and see what he was like:
A mighty body full of charm,
A heroic manner of great vigor.
The fangs protruding from his mouth were drills of steel;
His nose hung like a jade hook in the middle.
His golden eyes with pupils round gave animals a fright;
Demons and gods were scared of his bristling silver whiskers.
He sat upright by the cliff in terrible might,
Making the mist and wind as he hatched his plot.
On either side of him some thirty or forty junior demons could be seen, all drawn up in line and blowing out
mist and wind for all they were worth. Monkey grinned at this and thought, "So my master is clairvoyant. He
said it wasn't a heavenly wind, and it was in fact caused by this evil spirit trying to fool us. Now if I went
straight down and hit him with what they call a 'garlicsmasher' that'd kill him sure enough, but it would ruin
my reputation." Monkey had been a true hero all his life and was quite incapable of playing a dirty trick like
that.
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1189
"I'd better go back and give Pig some attention. I'll ask him to hit the evil spirit first. If Pig's good enough to
kill the evil spirit we'll be in luck. If he isn't and the evil spirit captures him I can come back to rescue him and
win myself a bit of fame. He's always putting on such an act and being so lazy−−he won't make an effort.
Still, he is very greedy and partial to a good feed. I think I'll try a trick on him and see how that works."
At once he brought his cloud down to land in front of Sanzang, who asked, "Are the wind and the mist sinister
or not?"
"It's clear now," Monkey replied. "They've gone."
"Yes," said Sanzang, "they have eased off a little."
"Master," said Monkey with a smile, "my eyesight is very good usually, but this time I was wrong. I thought
there'd probably be a monster behind that wind and mist but there wasn't."
"What caused them then?" Sanzang asked.
"There's a village not far ahead," Monkey replied, "where the people are so pious that they're steaming white
rice and white breadrolls to feed monks with. I think that the mist must have been steam escaping from their
steamers. It was the result of their goodness."
When Pig heard this he thought Monkey was telling the truth, so he grabbed hold of him and whispered, "Did
you eat their food before you came back?"
"Only a bit," Monkey replied. "The vegetable dishes were too salty−−I didn't want to eat too much."
"Screw that," said Pig. "I'd eat my fill of it however salty it was. If it made me really thirsty I'd come back for
a drink of water."
"Would you like some?" Monkey asked.
"Sure thing," Pig replied. "I'm hungry and I'd like some now. What do you think?"
"You mustn't even talk about it," said Monkey. "As the ancient book says, 'When the father is present the son
must do nothing on his own account.' Our master, who's as good as a father to you, is here, so none of us
should dare go ahead."
"If you'll say nothing about it, I'm going," replied Pig with a grin.
"Let's see how you do it," Monkey replied. "I'll say nothing." When it came to eating the idiot knew a thing or
two.
He went up to his master, made a loud "na−a−aw" of respect, and said, "Master, elder brother has just told me
that there are people in a village ahead of us who feed monks. Just look at that horse. It looks as though it's
going to start playing it up. We'll be causing a lot of trouble if we have to ask for grass and other fodder for it.
Luckily the wind and the clouds have gone now, so why don't you all sit here for a while while I fetch some
tender grass? We can go and beg for food from that house when we've fed the horse."
"Splendid," said the Tang Priest with delight. "I wondered why you've become so hardworking today. Be as
quick as you can."
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1190
Smiling secretly to himself the idiot started out. "Brother," said Monkey, catching up and grabbing hold of
him, "they feed monks all right, but only good−looking ones."
"In that case I'll have to change again," said Pig.
"Yes," said Brother Monkey, "you change."
The splendid idiot, who could perform thirty−six transformations, went into a hollow on the mountainside,
made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook himself and turned himself into a short, skinny
monk, beating a wooden fish−shaped dram with his hand and mumbling, "Oh great one, oh great one,"
because he knew no scriptures to recite.
After putting away the wind and the mist the evil spirit ordered all his devils to form a circle round the main
road, ready for any travelers. The idiot's luck was out, and he was soon inside the trap and surrounded by the
devils, who grabbed at his clothes and his silken sash as they all crowded in on him together.
"Don't pull," Pig said. "You can let me eat in all your houses in turn."
"What do you want to eat, monk?" the devils asked. "You feed monks here," Pig replied, "and I've come to be
fed."
"So you're hoping to be fed, are you, monk?" said the demons. "You don't seem to realize that what we like
doing best here is eating monks. We're all evil immortals who've found the Way here in the mountains, and
the only thing we want to do is to catch you monks, take you home with us, pop you in the steamer till you're
tender and eat you. And you're still hoping for a vegetarian meal!"
At this Pig's heart was filled with terror, and he started complaining about Monkey. "That Protector of the
Horses is a crook. He lied to me about them feeding monks in this village. There aren't any villagers here and
there's nobody who feeds monks. They're all evil spirits." The idiot was being tugged at so hard that he turned
back into himself, pulled the rake out from his belt and struck out wildly, driving all the junior devils back.
They rushed back to report to the senior demon, "Disaster, Your Majesty."
"What disaster?" the senior demon asked.
"A neat−looking monk came along in front of the mountain," they replied, "so we decided to catch him and
steam him. We were going to keep what we couldn't eat now for a bad day. Then to our astonishment he
transformed himself."
"What did he turn himself into?" the senior demon asked.
"Not into anything human," they replied. "He's got a long snout, big ears, and a bristly mane on his back. He
lashed out furiously at us with a rake that he used two−handed. He gave us such a terrible fright that we've run
straight back to report to Your Majesty."
"Don't be afraid," the senior demon said. "Let me go and have a look." Swinging his iron mace he went up for
a closer look and saw that the idiot really was hideous. This is what he looked like:
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1191
A snout like a husking hammer over three feet long;
Tusks like silver nails protruding from his mouth.
Two round eyes that flashed like lightning;
A pair of ears that made a howling wind when they flapped.
The bristles behind his head were rows of iron arrows;
All of his hide was rough and green and scabby.
In his hands he held an amazing object:
A nine−toothed rake of which everyone was afraid.
Summoning up his courage, the evil spirit shouted, "Where are you from? What's your name? Tell me at once
and I'll spare your life."
To this Pig replied with a laugh, "So you can't recognize your own ancestor Pig either, my boy. Come closer
and I'll tell you:
For my huge mouth and tusks and mighty powers
I was made Marshal Tian Peng by the Jade Emperor,
Commanding eighty thousand marines on the River of Heaven,
And happy amid all the joys of the heavenly palace.
Because when drunk I fluted with a palace lady
I decided to play the hero for a while.
One butt from my snout destroyed the Dipper and Bull Palace;
I ate the magic mushrooms of the Queen Mother of the West.
The Jade Emperor himself gave me two thousand hammer−blows,
Made me an exile from the world of Heaven.
This made me determined to nourish my spirit,
And become an evil monster in the lower world.
Just when I had made a good marriage in Gao Village
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1192
Fate brought me up against my brother Monkey.
He subdued me with his gold−banded cudgel;
I was forced to bow my head and enter the Buddhist faith.
I do the heavy work, saddle the horse and carry luggage:
I must have been the Tang Priest's debtor in an earlier life.
As the iron−footed Marshal Tian Peng my surname was Zhu;
My name as a Buddhist is Zhu Bajie."
When the evil spirit heard this he shouted, "So you're the Tang Priest's disciple. I've long heard that his flesh
is very tasty. You're one of the people I most want to catch. I'm not going to spare you now you've fallen into
my clutches. Stay where you are, and take this from my mace."
"Evil beast," Pig replied. "You must have been a dyer before."
"What do you mean, I must have been a dyer?" the evil spirit asked.
"If you weren't a dyer, how come you know how to use a pestle?" Pig retorted, and with no further argument
the monster was upon him, striking furiously. They fought a fine battle in the mountain hollow:
A nine−toothed rake,
An iron mace.
As the rake went through its movements they were like a howling gale;
The mace's skilful blows came as thick and fast as rain.
One was an unknown ogre blocking the mountain road;
The other was the offending Tian Peng now guarding his true nature's master.
When one's nature is right monsters cause no fear;
When the mountain is high earth cannot come from metal.
One fought with his mace like a python from a pool;
The other's rake was like a dragon from the waters.
Their angry shouts shook mountains and rivers;
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1193
Their mighty roars caused terror down in hell.
Each of the heroes displayed his prowess,
Staking his life on his magical powers.
We will say no more of how Pig set a mighty wind blowing as he fought the evil spirit, who ordered his junior
devils to keep Pig surrounded. Instead the story tells how Brother Monkey suddenly gave a bitter laugh
behind the Tang Priest's back.
"Why are you laughing like that, elder brother?" Friar Sand asked.
"Pig really is an idiot," Monkey replied. "As soon as he heard that they feed monks there he fell for my trick.
He's been away a long time now. If he'd beaten the evil spirit with a single blow of his rake you'd have seen
him coming back in triumph by now, loudly insisting on his great victory. But if the demon's been too much
for him and captured him my luck's out. Goodness only knows how often he'll have cursed the Protector of the
Horses behind my back. Say nothing while I go to take a look around, Wujing."
With that the splendid Great Sage, who did not want the venerable elder to know what was happening, quietly
pulled a hair out of the back of his head, blew on it with magic breath, said "Change!" and turned it into his
own double to stay with the master together with Friar Sand. Then his real self disappeared as he leapt up into
the air to look around. He saw the idiot lashing out wildly with his rake at the devils who were surrounding
him and gradually getting the better of him.
This was more than Monkey could bear. Bringing his cloud down to land, he shouted at the top of his voice,
"Take it easy, Pig. Monkey's here." Recognizing that it was Monkey's voice gave the idiot a chance to be
more ferocious than ever as he hit wildly forward with his rake. The evil spirit was no match for him.
"You weren't up to much before, monk," he said, "so how come you're so fierce now?"
"You'd better stop bullying me now, my lad," Pig replied. "I've got one of my people here now." A moment
later he was swinging wildly again with the rake. The evil spirit, unable to stave off the blows, led his devils
away in defeat. As soon as Monkey saw that the devils had been beaten he drew no closer but went straight
back on his cloud, shook the hair and put it back on his body. With his mortal, fleshly eyes the Tang Priest
noticed nothing of this.
Before long a triumphant Pig returned too, so exhausted that his nose was dripping with snot as he foamed at
the mouth and was panting loudly. "Master!" he called.
When the Tang Priest saw him he exclaimed in astonishment, "Pig, you went to fetch some grass for the
horse. Why have you come back in so terrible a state? Were there watchmen on the mountain who wouldn't
let you cut any?"
The idiot flung his rake down, beat his chest and stamped his feet as he replied, "Don't ask me about it,
Master. If I had to tell you I'd die of shame."
"What would you be so ashamed of?" Sanzang asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1194
"Elder brother tricked me," Pig replied. "He told me that it wasn't an evil spirit behind that wind and mist. He
said there was nothing sinister about it, but that it was from a village where the people were so pious that they
were steaming white rice and breadrolls made with white flour to feed monks with. I believed him. As I was
so hungry I thought I'd go ahead to beg for some. Fetching grass for the horse was only an excuse. I never
expected to be surrounded by a crowd of evil spirits. They gave me a hard fight, and if Monkey hadn't helped
me out with his mourner's staff I'd have had no hope of escaping and getting back here."
'The idiot's talking nonsense," said Monkey, who was standing beside them, with a smile. "If you've taken to
robbery you're trying to get a whole gaolful of people into trouble. I've been looking after the master here. I've
never left his side."
"It is true," Sanzang said, "Wukong has never left my side."
The idiot then sprang up shouting, "You don't understand, Master. He's got a double."
"Is there really a monster there, Wukong?" Sanzang asked. Monkey could keep his deception up no longer.
"There are a few little devils," Monkey replied with a bow and a smile, "but they won't dare give us any
trouble. Come here, Pig. I'm going to look after you. We're going to escort the master along this steep
mountain path as if we were an army on the march."
"How?" Pig asked.
"You'll be the commander of the vanguard," Monkey replied, "going in front and clearing the way. If the evil
spirit doesn't show up again that will be that; but if he does, you fight him. When you beat the evil spirit that'll
be something to your credit."
Reckoning that the evil spirit's powers were much the same as his own, Pig said, "Very well then. I'm ready to
die at his hands. I'll take the lead."
"Idiot," said Monkey, "if you start by saying such unlucky things you'll never get anywhere."
"As you know, brother," Pig replied,
"When a gentleman goes to a banquet
He gets either drunk or well filled;
When a hero goes into a battle
He gets either wounded or killed.
By saying something unlucky first I'll make myself stronger later." This delighted Monkey, who saddled the
horse and invited the master to ride while Friar Sand carried the luggage as they all followed Pig into the
mountains.
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1195
The evil spirit meanwhile led a few of his underlings who had survived the rout straight back to his cave,
where he sat brooding in silence high up above a rocky precipice. Many of the junior devils who looked after
things in his household came up to him and asked, "Why are you so miserable today, Your Majesty? You're
usually in−such high spirits when you come back."
"Little ones," said the demon king, "usually when I go out to patrol the mountains I can be sure of bringing
home a few people or animals I've caught to feed you with. Today my luck was out: I've met my match."
"Who?" the junior devils asked.
"A monk," the demon king replied, "a disciple of the Tang Priest from the East who's going to fetch the
scriptures. He's called Zhu Bajie. He went for me so hard with his rake that he beat me. I had to run away. I'm
thoroughly fed up. For ages now I've heard it said that the Tang Priest is an arhat who has cultivated his
conduct for ten successive lifetimes. Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever. To my surprise
he's come to my mountain today, and it would have been an ideal time to catch him, cook him and eat him. I
never realized he'd have a disciple like that one."
Before he had finished saying this a junior devil slipped forward from the ranks. First he gave three sobs in
front of the demon king, then three laughs.
"Why sob then laugh?" shouted the demon king.
The junior devil fell to his knees as he replied, "Because Your Majesty just said that you wanted to eat the
Tang Priest. His flesh isn't worth eating."
"But everyone says that a piece of his flesh will make you live as long as the heavens," said the demon king.
"How can you say that it's not worth eating?"
"If he were so good to eat," the junior devil replied, "he'd never have got this far. Other demons would have
eaten him up. And he's got three disciples with him."
"Do you know who?" the demon king asked.
"The senior disciple is Sun the Novice," said the junior devil, "and the third disciple is Friar Sand. The one
you met must have been his second disciple Zhu Bajie."
"How does Friar Sand compare with Zhu Bajie?" asked the demon king.
"He's much the same," the junior devil said,
"What about Sun the Novice?" the demon king asked, at which the junior devil thrust out his tongue in horror
and replied, "I daren't tell you. That Monkey has tremendous magic powers and can do all sorts of
transformations. Five hundred years ago he made terrible havoc in heaven. None of the heavenly warriors
dared give him any trouble, from the Twenty−eight Constellations, the Star Lords of the Nine Bright Shiners,
the Gods of the Twelve Branches, the Five Officers and the Four Ministers, the East and West Dippers and the
Gods of the North and the South, to the Five Peaks and the Four Rivers. How can you have the nerve to want
to eat the Tang Priest?"
"How do you know so much about him?" the demon king asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1196
"I used to live in the Lion Cave of the demon king on Lion Ridge," the junior devil replied. "He was reckless
enough to want to eat the Tang Priest, and that Sun the Novice smashed his way in through the gates with his
gold−banded cudgel. It was terrible. They were wiped out. Luckily I had enough sense to escape by the back
door and come here, where Your Majesty allowed me to stay. That's how I know about his powers."
The senior demon turned pale with shock when he heard this: it was a case of the commander−in−chief being
afraid of the soothsayer's words. How could he help being alarmed when he heard all this from one of his own
people? Just when they were all feeling terrified another junior devil stepped forward and said, "Don't be so
upset and afraid, Your Majesty. As the saying goes, easy does it. If you want to catch the Tang Priest let me
make you a plan to capture him."
"What plan?" the senior demon asked.
"I have a plan to 'divide the petals of the plum blossom.'"
"What do you mean by 'dividing the petals of the plum blossom?'" the demon king asked.
"Call the roll of all the devils in the cave," the junior devil replied. "Choose the best hundred from all
thousand of them, then the best ten out of that hundred, and finally the best three out of the ten. They must be
capable and good at transformations. Have them all turn into Your Majesty's doubles, wear Your Majesty's
helmet and armor, carry Your Majesty's mace, and lie in wait in three different places. First send one out to
fight Zhu Bajie, then one to fight Sun the Novice and finally one to fight Friar Sand. This way you'll only
have to spare three junior devils to draw the three disciples away. Then Your Majesty will be able to stretch
down from mid−air with your cloud−grabbing hand to catch the Tang Priest. He'll be in the bag. It'll be as
easy as catching flies in a dish of fish juice. Nothing to it."
This suggestion delighted the demon king, who said, "What a brilliant plan, brilliant! If I don't catch the Tang
Priest this way, that'll be that. But if I do I can assure you you'll be richly rewarded. I'll make you commander
of the vanguard." The junior devil kowtowed to thank him for his grace and went off to call the roll of the
devils. After all the monsters in the cave had been carefully checked through, three capable junior devils were
selected. They turned into the senior devil's doubles and went to lie in wait for the Tang Priest with their iron
maces.
The venerable Tang elder meanwhile was following Pig along the way without a care in the world. When they
had been going for some time there was a crashing sound from beside the track and out leapt a junior devil
who rushed straight at them, evidently to grab Sanzang. "The evil spirit's here, Pig," Monkey shouted. "Get
him!"
The idiot, who was taken in by the imposture, hacked wildly at the devil with his rake. The evil spirit parried
Pig's blows with his mace as he met the onslaught. While the battle between the pair of them ebbed and
flowed on the mountainside there was a noise in the undergrowth as another monster sprang out and charged
at the Tang Priest.
"This is bad, Master," said Monkey. "Pig can't see straight. He's let the monster escape to catch you. I'm going
to fight him." Pulling his cudgel out in a flash, he went up to the monster, shouting, "Where d'you think you're
going? Take this!"
Without saying a word the evil spirit raised his mace to meet the attack. But while the two of them were
locked in combat, swinging at each other, there was a howling wind from the other side of the mountain and a
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1197
third evil spirit sprang out who also rushed straight at the Tang Priest. When Friar Sand saw it he exclaimed in
alarm, "Master, big brother and second brother both can't see straight. They've let the evil spirit get away to
catch you. Stay on the horse while I get him."
Friar Sand was taken in too. Brandishing his staff he blocked the evil spirit's iron mace and started a bitter
combat. It was a wild fight with shouts and awful yells, and they drew further and further away. When the
demon king saw from up in the sky that the Tang Priest was alone on the horse he reached down with his
five−clawed steel hook and seized him. The master lost horse and stirrups as the evil spirit carried him off in a
gust of wind. Alas! This was a case of
When the dhyana−nature encountered a monster the true achievement was hard;
The monk of the river current met once more with a star of disaster.
Bringing his wind down to land, the demon king took the Tang Priest into the cave and called, "Commander
of the vanguard!"
The junior devil who had made the plan came forward, knelt and said, "I am not worthy."
"How can you say that?" the demon king replied. "Once the commander−in−chief has spoken, white becomes
black. What I said before was that if I failed to catch the Tang Priest, that would be that; but that if I
succeeded I'd make you my commander of the vanguard. Your brilliant plan has succeeded today, so there is
no reason why I should break faith with you. Bring the Tang Priest here and tell the underlings to fetch water,
scrub the cooking pot, fetch some firewood and light the fire. When he's been steamed you and I will each
have a piece of his flesh and live for ever."
"Your Majesty," the commander of the vanguard replied, "he mustn't be eaten yet."
"Why ever not?" the demon king asked. "We've captured him."
"It wouldn't matter if you ate him, Your Majesty," said the commander of the vanguard, "as far as Zhu Bajie
and Friar Sand are concerned. They would be reasonable. But I'm worried about that Sun the Novice: he'd be
really vicious. If he found out we'd eaten the Tang Priest he wouldn't come to give us a straight fight. He'd just
thrust that gold−banded cudgel of his into the mountainside and make a hole so big that the whole mountain
would collapse. We'd be homeless."
"What do you suggest, commander of the vanguard?" the demon king asked.
"In my opinion," the commander replied, "we should send the Tang Priest out to the back garden, tie him to a
tree, and starve him for two or three days. That will clean him up inside and let us make sure that the three
disciples don't come here looking for him. Once we've found out that they've gone home we can bring the
Tang Priest out and enjoy him at our leisure. That'd be better, wouldn't it?"
"Yes, yes," the senior demon said with a laugh. "You're right, commander of the vanguard."
An order was issued and the Tang Priest taken into the back garden to be roped to a tree, while all the junior
devils went out to the front to keep watch. Look at the venerable elder as he suffers in his bonds, tied up
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1198
tightly and unable to stop the tears rolling down his cheeks.
"Disciples," he called, "where did you chase those demons to when you went to capture them in the
mountains? I have been captured by a wicked ogre and have met with disaster. When will I ever see you
again? The pain is killing me."
Just when the tears from both eyes were joining in a single stream he heard someone calling from a tree
opposite, "Venerable elder, you're here too."
Taking control of himself, the Tang Priest asked, "Who are you?"
"I'm a woodcutter who lives on this mountain," the other replied. "I've been tied up here for three days. I
reckon they're going to eat me."
"Woodcutter," said the Tang Priest with tears in his eyes, "If you die it will only be you. You have nothing
else to worry about. But if I die it won't be a clean end."
"What do you mean, it won't be a clean end, venerable elder?" the woodcutter asked. "You have no parents,
wife or children, so if you die that'll be that."
"I am from the East," the Tang Priest replied, "and was going to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven.
I was going on the orders of Emperor Taizong of the Tang to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true
scriptures. This was to save all the lonely souls in the underworld who have nobody to care for them. If I lose
my life today the vain waiting will kill my sovereign and I will let down his ministers. Countless wronged
souls in the City of the Unjustly Slain will suffer a terrible disappointment and never ever be able to escape
from the wheel of life. The true achievement will all be turned to dust in the wind. How can that possibly be
considered a clean end?"
When the woodcutter heard this the tears fell from his eyes as he said, "If you die that is all there to it. But my
death will be even more painful for me to bear. I lost my father when I was a boy, and live alone with my
mother. Because we had no property I have had to make our living as a woodcutter. My aged mother is
eighty−two this year and I am her only support. If I die who will there be to bury her? It's very hard to bear:
the pain of it is killing me."
When the venerable elder heard this he began to wail aloud, "Oh dear, oh dear,
Even the mountain man thinks of his mother;
I am reciting the sutras in vain.
Serving one's monarch and serving one's parents are both the same in principle. You are moved by your
mother's goodness to you and I by my sovereign lord's goodness to me." This was indeed a case of
Weeping eyes looking at eyes that weep,
Journey to the West
Chapter 85 1199
A heartbroken one who sees off one with a broken heart.
But we will say no more of Sanzang's sufferings as we return to Monkey, who after driving the junior devil
back down the grassy slope rushed back to the track to find that his master had disappeared. All that was left
were the white horse and the luggage. In his alarm he led the horse and shouldered the carrying−pole as he
headed for the top of the mountain in his search for the master. Oh dear! Indeed:
The long−suffering monk of the river current had met with new suffering;
The Great Sage, subduer of demons, had run into a demon.
If you do not know how his search for his master ended, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 86
The Mother of Wood Lends His Might in Defeating the Ogre
The Metal Lord Uses His Magic to Wipe Out the Monster
The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey was leading the horse and carrying the baggage while he searched
the whole mountain top, calling out for his master. Suddenly Pig came running up to him, puffing and
panting, to ask, "Why are you shouting like that, brother?"
"The master's disappeared," Brother Monkey replied. "Have you seen him?"
"Why did you have to play that trick on me when I was being a good monk with the Tang Priest?" Pig asked.
"What was all that about me being commander of the vanguard? I had to fight for my life before I could beat
that evil spirit and come back in one piece. You and Friar Sand were looking after the master, so why ask me
about it?"
"I don't blame you, brother," said Monkey. "Somehow or other your eyes must have gone blurred−−you let
the evil spirit get away and come back to catch the master again. When I went off to fight it I told Friar Sand
to look after the master, and he's disappeared too."
"I expect he's taken the master somewhere for a crap," said Pig with a grin, but before he had finished
speaking Friar Sand turned up.
"Where's the master, Friar Sand?" Monkey asked.
"You two must both be blind," retorted Friar Sand, "letting the evil spirit escape to come back for the master.
When I went to fight the evil spirit the master was left in the horse by himself."
At this Monkey leapt with rage, shouting, "He's fooled me! He's fooled me!"
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1200
"How's he fooled you?" Friar Sand asked.
"It was a 'dividing the petals of the plum blossom' trick," Monkey replied, "to draw us three off so that he
could make a blow for the heart and carry off the master. Whatever in the name of Heaven are we to do?"
He could not stop the tears from streaming down his cheeks, at which Pig said, "Don't cry. If you cry you're a
pustule. He can't be far away. He must be on this mountain. Let's look for him." The three of them had no
better plan than to look for him on the mountain. When they had covered some six or seven miles they saw a
cave palace at the foot of a beetling precipice:
Clean−cut pinnacles blocking the light,
Towering and grotesque−shaped rocks.
The fragrance of rate and wonderful flowers,
The beauty of red apricots and green peaches.
The ancient trees in front of the precipice,
Forty spans round, and with bark scarred by frost and rain;
The azure pines standing outside the gates,
Two thousand feet of green blue reaching up to the sky.
Pairs of wild cranes
That dance in the breeze at the mouth of the cave;
Mountain birds in couples
Chirping by day at the ends of the branches.
Clumps of yellow creepers like ropes,
Rows of misty willows with leaves like hanging gold.
Water fills the pools that are square;
All over the mountain are caves that are deep.
In the pools that are square
Dragons lie hidden with scales unchanged.
In the mountain's deep caves
Dwell ogres that long have been eaters of humans.
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1201
This can be matched with the lands of immortals,
A den where the winds and the vapors are stored.
When Monkey saw this he took two or three paces forward, sprang towards the gates and saw that they were
shut tight. Above them was a horizontal stone tablet on which was written in large letters
LINKED RING CAVE:
BROKEN RIDGE:
HIDDEN MISTS MOUNTAIN.
"Strike, Pig," said Monkey. "This is where the evil spirit lives. The master must be here."
At this the idiot turned vicious, raised his rake, and brought it down on the gates with all his strength,
smashing a big hole in them and shouting, "Ogre, send my master out at once if you don't want me to smash
your gates down and finish the lot of you off." At this the junior devils on the gates rushed back inside to
report, "Disaster, Your Majesty."
"What disaster?" the senior demon asked.
"Someone's smashed a hole in the front gates and is yelling that he wants his master," the junior devils replied.
"I wonder which one's come looking for him," said the demon king in a state of great alarm.
"Don't be frightened," said the commander of the vanguard. "Let me go out and take a look." He hurried
straight to the front gates, twisted his head to one side and craned to look through the hole that had been
smashed in them. He saw someone with a long snout and big ears.
"Don't worry, Your Majesty," he turned round and shouted at the top of his voice, "it's Zhu Bajie. He's not up
to much and he won't dare try any nonsense on us. If he does we can open the gates and drag him inside to put
in the steamer too. The only one to worry about is that hairy−cheeked monk with a face like a thunder god."
"Brother," said Pig when he heard this from outside, "he's not scared of me but he is of you. The master's
definitely inside. Come here quick."
"Evil damned beast," said Monkey abusively. "Your grandfather Monkey is here. Send my master out and I'll
spare your life."
"This is terrible, Your Majesty," the commander of the vanguard reported. "Sun the Novice is here looking for
him too." At this the demon king started complaining, "It's all because of your 'petal−dividing' or whatever
you called it. You've brought disaster on us. How is this going to end?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1202
"Don't worry, Your Majesty," the commander of the vanguard replied, "and don't start grumbling yet. That
Sun the Novice is a monkey of great breadth of spirit. Although he has such tremendous magical power he's
partial to flattery. We'll take an imitation human head out to fool him with, say a few flattering things to him
and tell him we've eaten his master already. If we can take him in, the Tang Priest will be ours to enjoy. If we
can't we'll have to think again."
"But where are we to get an imitation human head?" the demon king asked.
"I'll see if I can make one," the commander of the vanguard replied.
The splendid ogre then cut a piece of willow root with an axe of pure steel into the shape of a human head,
spurted some human blood on it from his mouth to make it all sticky, and told a junior devil to take it to the
gates on a lacquer tray, calling, "My Lord Great Sage, please overcome your anger and allow me to address
you."
Brother Monkey really was partial to being flattered, and when he heard himself being addressed as "My Lord
Great Sage" he grabbed hold of Pig and said, "Don't hit him. Let's hear what he has to say."
To this the junior devil with the tray replied, "When my king took your master into the cave the junior devils
were naughty and behaved very badly. They gobbled and gnawed and grabbed and bit, and ate the whole of
your master up except his head, which I have here."
"If you've eaten him up, that's that," Monkey replied. "Bring the head out and let me see whether it's real or
false." The junior devil threw the head out through the hole in the gates, a sight that started Pig howling and
saying, "This is terrible. The master went in looking one way and he's come out looking like this."
"Idiot," said Monkey, "have a look and find out if it's real before you start crying."
"You're shameless," said Pig, "how could there ever be such a thing as a fake human head?"
'This one's a fake," Brother Monkey replied.
"How can you tell?" Pig asked. "When you throw a real human head it lands quietly," Monkey explained, "but
when you throw a fake it makes a loud noise like a pair of wooden clappers. If you don't believe me, I'll throw
it for you. Listen!" He picked the head up and threw it against a rock, where it gave a hollow ring.
"It was loud, brother," said Friar Sand.
"That means it's a fake," said Monkey. "I'll make it turn back into its real self to show you." Producing his
gold−banded cudgel in a flash he hit the head open. When Pig looked he saw that it was a piece of willow
root. This was too much for the idiot, who started talking abusively.
"I'll get you, you hairy lot," he said, "you may have hidden my master in your cave and fooled your ancestor
Pig with a piece of willow root, but don't imagine that my master is just a willow−tree spirit in disguise."
The junior devil who was holding the tray was thrown into such a panic by this that he ran shaking with fear
back to report, "It's terrible, terrible, terrible."
"What's so terribly terrible then?' the senior demon asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1203
"Zhu Bajie and Friar Sand were taken in, but Monkey's like an antique dealer−−he really knows his stuff," the
junior demon replied. "He could tell it was an imitation head. If only we could give him a real human head he
might go away."
"But how are we to get one?" the senior demon wondered, then continued, "Fetch a human head we haven't
eaten yet from the flaying shed." The devils then went to the shed and choose a fresh head, after which they
gnawed all the skin off it till it was quite smooth and carried it out on a tray.
"My lord Great Sage," the messenger said, "I am afraid it was a fake head last time. But this really is Lord
Tang's head. Our king had kept it so as to bring good fortune to our cave, but now he's making a special
offering of it." He then threw the head out through the hole in the gates, it landed with a thud and rolled on the
ground, gory with blood.
Seeing that this human head was a real one Monkey could not help starting to wail, in which he was joined by
Pig and Friar Sand.
"Stop crying, brother," said Pig, holding back his tears. "This is very hot weather, and the head will soon
become putrid. I'm going to fetch and bury it while it's still fresh. We can cry for him afterwards."
"You're right," said Monkey, and the idiot cradled the head against his chest, not caring about the filth, as he
hurried up the cliff till he found a South−facing spot where the winds and the natural forces were gathered.
Here he hacked out a hole with his rake, buried the head, and piled a grave−mound over it. Only then did he
say to Friar Sand, "You and big brother weep over him while I look for some offerings."
Going down to the side of a gill, he broke off some willow branches and gathered a few pebbles. Taking them
back up to the tomb, he planted the willow branches on either side and piled the pebbles in front of it. "What's
all that about?" Monkey asked.
"The willow branches are used instead of cypresses to shade the master's tomb for the time being," Pig
answered, "and the pebbles are offerings to him instead of cakes."
"Cretin!" Monkey shouted. "He's already dead. What do you want to go offering him stones for?"
"Just to show what the living feel," Pig replied, "and out of mourning and respect."
"You'd better cut that nonsense out," Monkey replied. "Tell Friar Sand to come here. He can guard the tomb
and keep an eye on the horse and the luggage while we two go and smash the cave palace up, capture the
monster and break his body into ten thousand bits. Then we'll have avenged the master."
"You're absolutely right, big brother," said Friar Sand through his tears. "You two be careful. I'll keep watch
here."
The splendid Pig then took off his black brocade tunic, tied his undershirt tightly, picked up his rake and
followed Monkey. The two of them rushed straight for the stone gates, and with no more ado they smashed
them down and shouted with a yell that made the heavens shake, "Give us our Tang Priest back alive!" This
sent the souls flying from all the devils old and young in the cave, who complained that the commander of the
vanguard had wronged them. "How are we going to deal with these monks now they've fought their way in
through the gates?" the demon king asked.
"The ancients used to say," the commander of the vanguard replied, "'Put your hand in a basket of fish and it's
bound to stink.' Now we're in this we've got to see it through. We'll just have to take our troops into battle
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1204
with these monks." When the demon heard this he had no alternative but to issue the order, "Stand together,
my little ones. Bring your best weapons with you and come with me." They then charged out through the
entrance of the cave with a great war cry.
The Great Sage and Pig quickly fell back a few paces before they held the devilish onslaught on a piece of flat
ground on the mountainside, shouting, "Who's your best−known boss? Who's the ogre who captured our
master?"
The devils had now palisaded their position, over which a multicolored embroidered flag flew, and the demon
king shouted straight back as he held the iron mace, "Damned monks! Don't you know who I am? I'm the
Great King of the Southern Mountains, and I've been running wild here for hundreds of years. I've eaten your
Tang Priest up. What are you going to do about it?"
"You've got a nerve, you hairy beast," retorted Monkey abusively. "How old are you, daring to call yourself
after the Southern Mountains? Lord Lao Zi was the ancestor who opened up heaven and earth, but even he sits
on the right of the Supreme Pure One. The Tathagata Buddha is the Honoured One who rules the world, and
he sits below the Great Roc. Confucius the Sage is the Honoured One of the Confucian School, and all he's
called is Master. So how dare you call yourself Great King of the Southern Mountains and talk about running
wild for several hundred years? Don't move, and take this from your grandfather's cudgel!"
The evil spirit twisted aside to avoid the cudgel, which he parried with his iron mace. "How dare you try to
put me down like that, monkey−face," said the monster, glaring furiously. "What kind of powers have you
got, acting like a maniac at my gates."
"I'll get you, you nameless beast," replied Brother Monkey with a grin. "You evidently don't know who I am,
so just stand there and make yourself brave while I tell you:
My ancestral home is in the Eastern Continent,
Where heaven and earth nourished me for thousands of years.
On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was a magic stone egg;
When the egg broke open my roots were inside.
My birth was not like that of an ordinary being:
My body was formed when sun and moon mated.
1 cultivated myself with formidable effect;
Heaven gave me a perceptive and cinnabar head.
As the Great Sage I dwelt in the palace in the clouds,
Using my strength in a fight against the Dipper and Bull Palace.
A hundred thousand heavenly troops could get nowhere near me;
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1205
All the stars in the sky were easily subdued.
My fame resounds throughout the cosmos;
I know all about everything between earth and sky.
Since my conversion to Sakyamuni's teachings
1 have been helping my master on his journey to the West.
When I clear a path through mountains no one can stop me;
My skill at bridging rivers causes demons distress.
In forests I use my power to seize tigers and leopards;
I capture wild beasts bare−handed before sheer cliffs.
For the sake of the East's true achievement I have come to the Western Regions;
What evil monster will dare to show itself?
I hate the wicked beasts who have murdered my master;
Their lives will all be ended at this moment."
These remarks both shocked and infuriated the ogre, who ground his teeth, sprang forward and struck at
Brother Monkey with his iron mace. Monkey blocked it effortlessly with his cudgel and would have said
some more to him when Pig, unable to restrain himself any longer, started swinging wildly at the demon
king's commander of the vanguard. The commander of the vanguard led his whole force into action, and a
hectic and splendid battle was fought on that piece of level ground on the mountainside:
The monk from the great and superior country in the East
Was going to fetch true scriptures from the Western Paradise.
The great leopard of the Southern mountains breathed out wind and clouds
To block their way through the mountains and show off his prowess.
With tricks
And deception
He had foolishly captured the priest from Great Tang.
Then he met Monkey with his tremendous powers
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1206
As well as the famous Zhu Bajie.
While the demons fought on level ground in the mountains
Dust clouds arose and darkened the sky.
Above the fray rose the junior devils' roars
As they thrust out wildly with spear and with sword.
On the other side the monks shouted back,
Fighting with rake and with cudgel together.
The Great Sage was a matchless hero,
And Pig in his perfection reveled in his strength.
The ancient ogre of the South,
And his vanguard commander
For the sake of a piece of the Tang Priest's flesh
Were prepared to throw their own lives away.
These two hated them for killing their master:
The other two were set on murder because of the Tang Priest.
The struggle long swayed to and fro,
The clashes and charges yielding no victor.
When Monkey realized that the junior devils were fighting so hard that repeated attacks were failing to drive
them back he used body−dividing magic, plucked out a bunch of hairs, chewed them up in his mouth, spat the
pieces out, called "Change!" and turned them all into his own doubles, each wielding a gold−banded cudgel
and fighting his way into the cave from the outside. The one or two hundred junior devils, unable to cope with
their attacks from all sides, all fled for their lives back into the cave. Monkey and Pig then fought their way
back out through the enemy ranks from the inside. The evil spirits who had no sense tried to stand up to the
rake and found themselves bleeding from nine wounds, or resisted the cudgel and had their flesh and bones
beaten to paste. The Great King of the Southern Mountains was so alarmed that he fled for his life on his
clouds and wind. The commander of the vanguard, who did not know how to do transformations, had already
fallen to Monkey's club and been revealed as what he really was: an iron−backed gray wolf ogre.
Pig went up to him, turned him over by his leg, and said, "Goodness only knows how many piglets and lambs
this so−and−so has eaten."
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1207
Monkey meanwhile shook himself, put the hair back on his body and said, "No time to lose, idiot. After the
demon king! Make him pay for the master's life." Pig turned back, but all the little Monkeys had disappeared.
"Your magic bodies have all gone, brother," he exclaimed.
"I've taken them back," Monkey replied.
"Splendid," said Pig, "splendid." The two of them went back in triumph, feeling very pleased.
When the senior demon escaped back to the cave he told his underlings to move rocks and earth to barricade
the front gates. The surviving junior demons were all trembling with terror as they barricaded the entrance:
they would not have dared to stick their heads out again now. Monkey led Pig to the gates and shouted
without getting any response. Pig's rake made no impression when he struck them with it.
Realizing what had happened, Monkey said, "Don't waste your effort, Pig. They've barricaded the gates."
"Then how are we going to avenge the master?" Pig asked.
"Let's go back to his grave and see Friar Sand," Brother Monkey replied.
When they got back there they found Friar Sand still weeping, at which Pig became more miserable than ever,
throwing down his rake, prostrating himself on the tomb mound and beating the ground with his hand as he
howled, "Poor, poor Master. Master from so far away! I'll never see you again!"
"Don't distress yourself so, brother," said Monkey. "The evil spirit may have barricaded his front gates, but
he's bound to have a back entrance to go in and out through. You two wait here while I go and look for it.
"Do be careful, brother," said Pig through his tears. "Don't get caught yourself too. We could never cope if we
had to wail for the master then for you by turns. We'd make an awful mess of it."
"No problem," said Monkey. "I've got my ways of doing things."
Putting his cudgel away the splendid Great Sage tightened his kilt, stepped out and went back over the
mountain. On his way he heard the sound of flowing water. When he turned round to look he saw that there
was a brook flowing down from above him, and beside the gill was a gate, to the left of which was a drainpipe
from which red water was coming out.
"Goes without saying," he thought. "That must be the back entrance. If I go as myself the junior demons may
well recognize me when I open the door and see them. I'd better turn into a water snake to go in. No, hold on.
If the master's spirit knows that I've turned into a water snake he'll be angry with me as a monk for turning
into something so long drawn−out. I'd better turn into a little crab. No, that's no good either. The master would
be cross with me for having too many legs for a monk." So he turned into a water rat who slipped into the
water with a soughing sound and went straight to the inner courtyard along the drainpipe. Here he thrust his
head out for a look around and saw some junior devils setting out gobbets of human flesh to dry in a sunny
spot.
"Heavens!" said Monkey. "That must be what they can't finish from the master's flesh. No doubt they're
drying it to save for a rainy day. If I turned back into myself now, went up to them and wiped them out with
one swing of my cudgel I'd be making myself look brave but stupid. I'll do another change, go in to look for
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1208
the senior devil, and find out what's what." With that he jumped out of the drain, shook himself, and turned
himself into a winged ant. Indeed:
Weak and tiny and known as black colts,
They hide away for many a day till they have wings and can fly.
Casually crossing beside the bridge they draw up their ranks;
They enjoy battles of high strategy under the bed.
Because they know when rain is coming they block their holes
And build their mounds of dust that turn to ashes.
Light they are, and delicate and quick,
Rarely observed as they pass the wicker gate.
He spread his wings and flew straight into the inner hall, unseen and unheard. Here the senior demon could be
seen sitting very angrily in the seat of honour, while a junior devil ran up from behind to report, "Many
congratulations, Your Majesty."
"What on?" the senior demon asked.
"I was on lookout by the gill outside the back door just now," the junior devil replied, "when suddenly I heard
some loud wails. I rushed up to the top of the mountain to take a look and saw Zhu Bajie, Sun the Novice and
Friar Sand all bowing to a grave and weeping bitterly. I think they must have taken that head for the Tang
Priest's and buried it, piled up a grave mound and mourned for it."
When Monkey overheard this he said to himself with delight, "From what he's said they've still got the master
here and haven't eaten him yet. I'll take a look around and find out if he's still alive, then have a word with
him."
The splendid Great Sage then flew into the main hall and looked all around until he saw a very tiny doorway
on one side of it. It was very firmly shut, and when he squeezed through the narrow gap between the doors he
found himself in a big garden in which he could vaguely make out the sound of sobbing. Flying further inside
he saw a clump of tall trees at the foot of which were tied two men. One of these was the Tang Priest. As soon
as Monkey saw him he felt an itch in his heart that he could not scratch.
He could not help turning back into himself, going up to Sanzang and calling, "Master."
When the Tang Priest saw who it was he started crying and saying, "Is that you, Wukong? Save me as quickly
as you can, Wukong."
"Don't keep saying my name, Master," Monkey replied. "There are people at the front and the secret may get
out. As you're still alive I can rescue you. The ogres said they'd already eaten you and tricked me with an
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1209
imitation human head. Now we're in a bitter struggle with them. There's no need to worry, Master. Just stick it
out for a little longer till I've beaten the evil spirit, then I'll be able to rescue you."
The Great Sage said the words of a spell, shook himself, turned into an ant again and flew back into the hall,
where he landed on the main beam. From here he saw the surviving junior devils jostling and shouting. One of
them sprang out from the crowd and said, "Your Majesty, now they know we've blocked the main gate and
they won't be able to fight their way in they've given up hope. They've even made a tomb for the wrong head.
They spent today mourning for him, and they'll do the same again tomorrow and the day after. I'm sure they'll
go away after that. Once we find out that they've split up we can bring the Tang Priest out, chop him up into
little bits, and fry him with aniseed. Then everyone will be able to eat a piece when he's steaming hot, and
we'll all live forever."
At this another junior devil clapped his hands together and said, "No, no, he'd taste much better steamed."
"Boiling him would save some firewood," another put in.
"He's such a rare and wonderful thing," said someone else, "that we ought to salt him down and take our time
over eating him."
When Monkey heard all this from up among the beams he thought with fury, "What harm did my master ever
do you? Why are you making these plans to eat him?" He pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them up into
little pieces, blew them lightly out of his mouth and silently recited the words of the spell that turned all the
pieces into sleep insects. These he threw into the faces of all the devils, and the insects crawled up their noses,
gradually making the devils feel sleepy. Before long the junior devils were all lying stretched out fast asleep.
The demon king was the only one left fitfully awake as he kept rubbing his face and head, sneezing and
pinching his nose.
"Perhaps he knows about how to cope with sleep insects," Monkey thought. "I'd better give him a double
dose." He pulled out a hair, made two more sleep insects as before, and threw them into the demon's face to
crawl up his nose, one up the left nostril and one up the right. The demon king jumped to his feet, stretched,
yawned twice and fell fast asleep, breathing heavily.
Quietly delighted, Monkey then sprang down from the roof and turned back into himself. He produced his
cudgel from his ear and waved it till it was the thickness of a duck egg, then with a loud bang broke down the
side door, ran into the garden at the back and called out, "Master!"
"Untie me quick, disciple," the venerable elder said. "Being roped up like this has been agony."
"Be patient, Master," said Monkey. "When I've killed the evil spirit I'll come and untie you." He then hurried
back into the hall, lifted his cudgel and was about to strike when he stopped and thought, "No, this is wrong. I
ought to release the master before I kill the evil spirit." He went back into the garden, where he changed his
mind again: "No, I'll kill the monster first." This happened two or three times till finally he came dancing back
into the garden, where his master's grief turned to joy at the sight of him.
"You monkey," he said, "I suppose it's because you're beside yourself with pleasure at seeing me still alive
that you're dancing about like that." Only then did Monkey go up to him, untie him, and help him walk away.
The man tied to the other tree then called out, "Please save me too in your great mercy, my lord."
The venerable elder stopped and said, "Untie him too, Wukong."
"Who's he?" Monkey asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1210
"He was captured and brought here a day before me," Sanzang replied. "He's a woodcutter. He tells me his
mother is very old and he is most worried about her. He is a very dutiful son. You must save him too."
Doing as he was bid, Monkey untied the other man and took them both out through the back gate, up the scar
and across the ravine. "Thank you for rescuing this man and me, worthy disciple," said Sanzang. "Where are
Wuneng and Wujing?"
"Mourning for you over there," Monkey replied, "Give them a shout."
Sanzang then shouted at the top of his voice, "Bajie! Bajie!" The idiot, who had been weeping so much that
his head was spinning, wiped away the snot and tears to call, "Friar Sand, the master's come back as a ghost.
That him calling, isn't it?"
"Idiot," shouted Monkey, going up to him, "that's no ghost. It's the master himself."
When Friar Sand looked up and saw who it was he fell to his knees in front of Sanzang and said "Master,
you've suffered terribly. How did big brother rescue you?" Monkey then told them everything that had
happened.
When Pig heard all this he gnashed his teeth, unable to restrain himself from knocking the tomb mound over
with one blow of his rake, digging out the head and smashing it to pulp "Why are you hitting it?" the Tang
Priest asked.
"Master," said Pig, "goodness only knows what kind of wretch he was, but we all mourned for him."
"It was thanks to him that I'm still alive," Sanzang replied. "When you disciples attacked their gates and
demanded me they took him out to fob you off with. Otherwise they would have killed me. I think we should
bury him properly as a mark of our monastic respect." When the idiot heard his master saying this he buried
that bag of flesh and bone that had been beaten to a pulp and piled up a tomb mound over it.
"Master," said Brother Monkey with a smile, "won't you sit here for a while while I go to wipe them out?"
With that he leapt down the cliff, crossed the ravine, went into the cave and took the ropes with which the
Tang Priest and the woodcutter had been hound into the hall, where he used them to truss together the arms
and legs of the demon king, who was still asleep. He then lifted the demon up with his cudgel onto his
shoulder and took him out by the back door.
"You like making things difficult for yourself, brother," said Pig when he saw him coming from a distance.
"Why don't you find another to balance him?"
Monkey then set the demon king down in front of Pig, who raised his rake and was just about to hit him when
Monkey said, "Wait a moment. We haven't captured the junior devils in the cave yet."
"If there are any left," Pig said, "take me in with you to smash them."
"Smashing them would be too much trouble," Monkey replied. "The best thing would be to find some
firewood and wipe them out that way."
When the woodcutter heard this he led Pig to a hollow to the East to find some broken ends of bamboo, pines
that had lost their needles, hollow stumps of willows, creepers broken off from their roots, withered artemisia,
old reeds, rushes and dead mulberry. They carried a lot of this into the back entrance, where Monkey set it
alight and Pig fanned the flames with both ears. Then the Great Sage sprang up, shook himself and put the
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1211
sleep−insect hairs back on his body. When the junior devils woke up they were all already on fire. Poor
things! None of them had the faintest chance of surviving. When the whole cave was burnt right out the
disciples went back to see the master.
When Sanzang saw that the senior demon had woken up and was shouting he called, "Disciples, the evil spirit
has come round." Pig went up and killed him with one blow of his rake, whereupon the ogre turned back into
his real form as a leopard spirit with a coat patterned like mugwort flowers.
"Leopards with flower−patterned coats can eat tigers," Monkey observed, "and this one could turn into a
human too. Killing him has prevented a lot of serious trouble in future." The venerable elder could not express
his gratitude strongly enough, and he then mounted the saddle. "My home isn't far from here to the Southwest,
sirs," said the woodcutter. "I invite you to come there to meet my mother and accept my kowtows of thanks
for saving my life. Then I'll see you gentlemen along your way."
Sanzang was happy to accept, and instead of riding he walked there with his three disciples and the
woodcutter. After they had followed a winding path to the Southwest for a short distance this is what they
saw.
Lichen growing across a stone−flagged path,
Wisteria joining across the wicker gate,
Chains of mountains on every side, And a wood full of singing birds.
A dense thicket of pine and bamboo,
Rare and wonderful flowers in profusion.
The place is remote and deep amid the clouds,
A thatched cottage with a bamboo fence.
While they were still some distance away they could make out an old woman leaning on the wicker gate with
tears streaming from her eyes, weeping and calling to heaven and earth for her son.
As soon as the woodcutter saw his mother he left the Tang Priest behind as he rushed straight to the gate, knelt
down and said, "Mother, I'm back."
Throwing her arms around him the woman said, "My boy, when you didn't come home for days on end I
thought the mountain lord must have caught you and killed you. I've suffered terrible heartache. If you weren't
killed why didn't you come back before? Where are your carrying−pole, ropes and axe?"
The woodcutter kowtowed as he replied, "Mother, the mountain lord did capture me and tie me to a tree. I was
lucky to escape with my life, thanks to these gentlemen. They are arhats sent by the Tang court in the East to
fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. This gentleman was captured by the mountain lord and tied to a
tree as well. His three disciples have enormous magic powers. They killed the mountain lord with a single
blow: he was a leopard with mugwort flower spots who had become a spirit. They burnt all the junior devils to
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1212
death, untied the senior gentleman and then untied me too. I owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude: but for
them your son would certainly be dead. Now that the mountain is completely safe I'll be able to walk around
at night without any danger."
After hearing this the old woman came forward to greet Sanzang and his disciples, kowtowing at every step.
Then she led them in through the wicker gate to sit down in the thatched cottage. Mother and son next
performed endless kowtows as expressions of their gratitude before hastily and in a fluster preparing them
some vegetarian food as a mark of their thanks.
"Brother," said Pig to the woodcutter, "I know you're hard up here. Just put something simple together for us.
Don't go to a lot of trouble and effort."
"Quite frankly, sir," the woodcutter replied, "we're very poor here. We don't have any gill fungus, button
mushrooms, peppers or aniseed. All we can offer you gentlemen are some wild vegetables."
"We're putting you to a lot of trouble," said Pig. "Be as quick as you can. We're starving."
"It'll soon be ready," the woodcutter replied, and before long a table and stools were set out and wiped clean,
and several dishes of wild vegetables served:
Tender−scalded day lilies,
White lumps of pickled scallion,
Knotweed and purslane,
Shepherds purse and "goosegut blossom."
The "swallows stay away" was delicious and tender;
The tiny fists of beansprouts were crisp and green.
Indigo heads boiled soft,
White−stewed "dog footprints,"
"Cat's ears,"
Wild turnips,
All with tender and tasty gray noodles.
"Scissor shafts,"
"Oxpool aid,"
Tipped in the pot with broom purslane.
Broken grain purslane,
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1213
And lettuce purslane,
All green, delicious and smooth.
"Birdflower" fried in oil,
Superb water−chestnuts,
Roots of reeds and wild−rice stems,
Four kinds of excellent water plants.
"Wheat−mother,"
Delicate and finely flavored;
"Raggedy patches"
You could never wear.
Under the bitter sesame bed runs a fence.
Sparrows wander around,
Macaques leave their footprints,
Eager to eat it all when fried and piping hot.
Sloping wormwood and green artemisia surround crown daisy chrysanthemums;
The moths fly around the buckwheat.
Bald "goat's ear,"
Wolfberry fruits,
That don't need oil when combined with dark indigo.
A meal of every kind of wild vegetable
As a mark of the woodcutter's reverent thanks.
When master and disciples had eaten their fill they packed up ready to start out again. Not daring to press
them to stay, the woodcutter asked his mother to come out and bow to them in thanks again. He then
kowtowed, fetched a club of jujube wood, fastened his clothes tight, and came out to see them on their way.
Friar Sand led the horse, Pig carried the shoulder−pole, and Monkey followed close behind them while the
master put his hands together on the back of the horse and said, "Brother woodcutter, could you kindly lead us
to the main track? We will take out leave of you there." Together they then climbed high, went down slopes,
Journey to the West
Chapter 86 1214
skirted ravines and negotiated inclines. "Disciples," said the venerable elder thoughtfully as he rode,
"Since leaving my monarch to come to the West
I have made a long journey across a great distance.
At each river and mountain I have met with disaster,
Barely escaping from monsters and fiends.
My heart has been set on the Three Stores of scriptures,
And my every thought is of Heaven above.
When will my toil and my labor be ended?
When will I go home, my journey completed?"
When the woodcutter heard Sanzang saying this he said, "Don't be so downhearted, sir. It's only some three
hundred miles West along this road to India, the land of paradise."
As soon as Sanzang heard this he dismounted and replied, "Thank you for bringing us so far. Now that we are
on the main track, please go home now, brother woodcutter, and give our respects to your venerable mother.
We poor monks have no way to reward you for the sumptuous meal you gave us just now except by reciting
surras morning and evening to protect you and your mother and enable both of you to live to be a hundred."
The woodcutter took his leave of them and went back by the way he had came. Master and disciples then
headed West together.
Indeed:
The ogre subdued and wrongs set to right, he escaped from his peril;
Having been shown this kindness he set out on his way with the greatest of care.
If you don't know how long it was till they reached the Western Heaven, listen to the explanation in the next
installment.
Chapter 87
When Heaven Is Offended in Fengxian It Stops the Rain
The Great Sage Urges Goodness and Brings a Downpour
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1215
Deep and mysterious is the Great Way;
What news is there of it?
When revealed it will alarm ghosts and divine beings.
It controls the universe,
Divides darkness and light;
In the world of true happiness there is no competition.
Before the Vulture Peak
Pearls and jewels emerge,
Shining with every color.
It illuminates all beings that live between heaven and earth;
Those who understand it live as long as mountains and seas.
The story tells how Sanzang and his three disciples took their leave of the woodcutter on the Hidden Clouds
Mountain and hurried along the main road. After they had been going for several days they suddenly saw a
walled and moated city not far before them.
"Wukong," said Sanzang, "is that city ahead of us India, do you think?"
"No, no," said Monkey shaking his head. "Although the Tathagata lives in a paradise there are no cities there.
It's a great mountain, Vulture Peak, on which are the high buildings and halls of Thunder Monastery. Even if
we've now reached the land of India this isn't where the Buddha lives. I don't know how far India is from
Vulture Peak. Presumably this city is one of the frontier prefectures of India. We'll know when we get there."
Soon they were outside the city, where Sanzang dismounted to go in through the triple gates. Here they found
the people destitute and the streets deserted. When they reached the market there were many black−clad
government servants lined up on either side of a number of officials wearing their hats and sashes of office
and standing under the eaves of a building. As the four travelers came along the road these men did not give
way at all, so Pig in his rough way raised his snout and shouted, "Out of the way! Out of the way!"
When the men looked up with a start and saw what he looked like their bones went soft, their sinews turned
numb and they fell over, shouting, "Evil spirits! Evil spirits!"
This gave the officials standing under the eaves such a fright that they were shivering as they bowed and
asked, "Where are you from?"
Sanzang, who was worried that his disciples would cause trouble, pushed himself forward and said to the men,
"I am a monk sent by His Majesty the Great Tang emperor to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the
scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery in the land of India. Our journey brings us to this distinguished
place, but as we do not know its name and have not yet found a place to stay we hope that you gentlemen will
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1216
forgive us if we have caused any offence to your customs on entering your city."
Only then did the officials return his courtesy and say, "This is the prefecture of Fengxian, one of the frontier
prefectures of India. Because we have been suffering from drought for years on end the marquis has sent us to
put up a notice here calling for masters of the Dharma to pray for rain and save the people."
"Where's the notice?" asked Monkey when he heard this.
"Here," the officials said. "The arcade has only just been swept clean: we haven't posted it yet."
"Bring it here and show me," said Brother Monkey. The officials then opened the notice out and hung it up
under the eaves. Monkey and the others went up to read it, and this was what was written on it:
Shangguan, Marquis of Fengxian Prefecture in Great India, issues this notice to invite enlightened teachers
and great masters of the Dharma. This country with its prosperous soldiers and people has been afflicted with
drought for years. Military and civil land alike has been devastated; the rivers have dried up and the ditches
are empty. There is no water in the wells, and the springs have stopped flowing. While the rich are barely
managing to stay alive, the poor cannot survive. A bushel of wheat costs a hundred pieces of silver; a bundle
of firewood costs five ounces. Girls of ten are being sold for three pints of rice; boys of five are being given to
whoever will take them. Because the city dwellers fear the law they pawn their clothes to buy the necessities
for survival; but in the countryside thugs rob and eat people in order to live. I have therefore issued this notice
in the hope that wise and worthy men from all around will pray for rain to save the people. The will be richly
rewarded for their kindness with a thousand pieces of silver. This is no empty promise. Let those who would
take it up come to this notice.
When he had read it Monkey asked the officials, "What's Shangguan?"
"Shangguan is our marquis' surname," they replied.
"It's a very rare surname," said Monkey with a laugh.
"You've never been to school, brother," said Pig. "There's a bit at the end of the book The Hundred Surnames
that goes 'Ouyang and Shangguan.'"
"Stop this idle chatter, disciples," said Sanzang. "If any of you know how to pray for rain, bring them a fall of
timely rain and save the people from this affliction: that would be a very good thing indeed to do. If you
cannot, we must be on our way and waste no more time."
"What's so difficult about praying for rain?" Monkey asked. "I can turn rivers upside down, stir up the sea,
move the stars and constellations about, kick the sky, churn up water in wells, breathe out mist and clouds,
carry mountains, drive the moon along and summon wind and rain. They're all child's play. Nothing to them!"
When the officials heard this they sent two of their number straight to the prefectural offices to report, "Your
Excellency, something very splendid indeed has happened."
The marquis, who was burning incense and praying silently at the time, asked what it was when he heard that
something splendid had happened. "We were taking the notice to post at the entrance to the market," the
officials replied, "when four monks came along who said that they have been sent by the Great Tang in the
East to the Great Thunder Monastery in India to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. As soon as they
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1217
read the notice they said they could bring timely rain, which is why we have come here to report."
Refusing to take a sedan−chair, horse or large retinue, the marquis went on foot in his robes of office straight
to the entrance to the market in order to invite the strangers with the utmost courtesy to pray for rain.
"His Excellency the marquis is here," it was suddenly announced, and everybody moved out of the way.
As soon as he saw the Tang Priest the marquis, who showed no fear of his hideous disciples, prostrated
himself in the middle of the street and said, "I am Marquis Shangguan of Fengxian Prefecture, and I have
bathed and perfumed myself in order to beg you teachers to pray for the rain that will save the people. I
implore you in your great mercy to give play to your divine powers and bring us deliverance."
Returning his courtesies, Sanzang said, "This is no place to talk. We will be able to act when we have gone to
a monastery."
"Please come with me to my humble palace," the marquis replied. "We have a pure place there."
Master and disciples then led the horse and carried the luggage straight to the palace, where they all
exchanged greetings and the marquis ordered tea and a vegetarian meal. When the food arrived a little later
Pig ate for all he was worth like a hungry tiger, terrifying the waiters, who trembled as they kept coming and
going with more and more soup and rice. They looked like the figures on one of those revolving lanterns, and
they could just keep him supplied until he had eaten his fill. Only then did he stop.
When the meal was over the Tang Priest expressed his thanks then asked, "How long has the drought lasted
here, Your Excellency?" To this the marquis replied,
"This is a part of the great land of India,
Fengxian Prefecture of which I am governor.
For three years on end we have suffered from drought:
Grass does not grow, and the grain has all died.
Business is hard for rich and for poor;
Nearly all of the families are weeping with grief.
Two thirds of the people have now died of starvation;
The rest barely survive, like a candle flame in the wind.
I have issued a notice for worthies
And am lucky you monks have come to our land.
If you bring the people a whole inch of rain
A thousand in silver will be your reward."
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1218
When Monkey heard this his face showed his pleasure as he chuckled, "Don't say that, don't say that. If you
promise us a reward of a thousand pieces of silver you won't get a single drop of rain. But if you put it in
terms of accumulating merit I'll provide you with plenty of rain."
The marquis, a thoroughly upright and good man who cared deeply for his people, invited Monkey to take the
seat of honour, then bowed to him and said, "Teacher, if you really can show us this great compassion this
humble official will do nothing to offend against morality."
"Please get up," said Monkey, "only look after my master well while I do the job."
"How are you going to do it, brother?" asked Friar Sand. "
"You and Pig are to must come here and be my assistants outside while I summon a dragon to make rain,"
Monkey replied. Pig and Friar Sand did as he bade them, and while the three of them went outside the marquis
burned incense and prayed. Sanzang sat there reciting sutras.
While Monkey recited the spell and said the magic words a dark cloud appeared to the East and slowly moved
till it was in front of the hall: it was Ao Guang, the ancient dragon of the Eastern Sea. Ao Guang then put
away his cloud feet and turned himself into human form to go up to Monkey, bow low to him with full
courtesy and ask, "What have you sent for this humble dragon to do, Great Sage?"
"Please rise," Monkey replied. "The only reason why I have troubled you to make this long journey is because
there has been a drought in this prefecture of Fengxian for years on end. I'd like to ask you if you couldn't
send some rain."
"I must inform you, Great Sage," the dragon replied, "that although I can make rain I can only act on the
orders of Heaven. I would never dare come here to make rain on my own authority without Heaven's
instructions."
"As our journey brought us this way I asked you specially to come here to make rain and save the people,"
said Monkey, "so why are you trying to get out of it?"
"I'd never dare," the dragon king replied. "I came because you summoned me with the magic words, Great
Sage, and I'd never dare try to get out of it. In the first place I haven't had an edict from Heaven, and secondly
I haven't brought the magic rain−making generals with me. How could I, Great Sage? If you wish to be a
savior, you must let me go back to the sea to muster my forces while you go to the heavenly palace to obtain
an imperial edict for a fall of rain and ask the officials in charge of water to release us dragons, so that I can
make rain in the quantities ordered."
Accepting the force of his argument, Brother Monkey had to let the old dragon go back to the sea. He then
told the Tang Priest what the dragon king had said.
"In that case you had better go and do that," the Tang Priest said. "But don't be telling lies."
Monkey then told Pig and Friar Sand to look after the master while he went up to the heavenly palace. No
sooner had the splendid Great Sage said he was going than he was out of sight.
"Where has Lord Sun gone?" the marquis asked, trembling with shock.
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1219
"He's gone up to Heaven on a cloud," replied Pig with a grin. With great reverence the marquis then issued an
urgent order that all the people in the big and little streets of the city, whether nobility, high officials, gentry,
commoners, soldiers or civilians, were to worship dragon−king tablets and set out water urns with sprigs of
willow in them in front of their gates. They were also to burn incense and pray to Heaven.
Once on his somersault cloud Monkey went straight to the Western Gate of Heaven, where the Heavenly King
Lokapala soon appeared at the head of his heavenly soldiers and warriors to greet him and say, "Great Sage,
have you fetched the scriptures yet?"
"Quite soon now," Monkey replied. "We've reached a frontier prefecture called Fengxian on the borders of
India now. It hasn't rained for three whole years there, and the people are suffering terribly. I want to pray for
rain to save them. I sent for the dragon king, but he told me that he couldn't do it on his own authority without
a heavenly order, which is why I've come to see the Jade Emperor to request an edict."
"I don't think it's supposed to rain there," the heavenly king said. "I heard just now that the marquis of
Fengxian had behaved disgracefully and offended both Heaven and Earth. His Majesty took it badly and
immediately had a rice mountain, a flour mountain and a huge gold lock set up. It won't rain till all three have
been knocked over or snapped." Not understanding what all this was about, Monkey demanded to see the Jade
Emperor, and, not daring to stop him, the heavenly king let him in.
Going straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness, Brother Monkey was met by the four heavenly teachers,
who asked, "What are you here for, Great Sage?"
"On my journey escorting the Tang Priest I've reached Fengxian Prefecture on the frontiers of India, where
there is a drought," Monkey replied. "The marquis there has been asking for magicians to pray for rain. I sent
for the dragon king to order him to make rain, but he said that he could not do so on his own authority without
an edict from the Jade Emperor. I have now come to request an edict in order to relieve the people's
suffering."
"But it's not supposed to rain there," said the four heavenly teachers.
"As to whether it's supposed to rain or not," said Monkey with a smile, "could I trouble you to take me in to
submit a memorial so that I can find out whether I can still get a favour done?"
To this the heavenly teacher Ge Xianweng replied, "As the saying goes, 'a fly that needs a net for a
veil−−what a nerve!'"
"Don't talk nonsense," said Xu of Jingyang. "Just take him in."
Qiu Hongji, Zhang Daoling, Ge and Xu took Monkey to the outside of the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where
they reported, "Your Majesty, Sun Wukong has reached Fengxian Prefecture in India and wants to obtain rain.
He has come to ask for an edict."
"Three years ago," the Jade Emperor replied, "on the twenty−fifth day of the twelfth month, when we were
inspecting the myriad heavens and travelling through the three worlds, we arrived at his city. We saw that
Shangguan was most wicked; he knocked over the vegetarian offerings to heaven to feed to dogs, spoke
foully, and was guilty of lese−majeste. That is why we set up those three things in the Hall of Fragrance. Take
Sun Wukong to see them. When those three things have been accomplished we will issue our edict; but if they
are not, then do not meddle in what does not concern you."
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1220
When the four heavenly teachers led Brother Monkey to the Hall of Fragrance he saw a mountain of rice
about a hundred feet high and a mountain of flour about two hundred feet high. Beside the rice mountain was
a chicken the size of a fist eating the rice, sometimes with quick pecks, sometimes with slow ones. Beside the
flour mountain was a golden−haired Pekinese licking the flour, sometimes with long licks and sometimes with
short ones. To the left of it a golden padlock about one foot three or four inches long hung from an iron frame.
The crossbar of the lock was about the thickness of a finger, and under it was a lamp, the flame of which was
heating the bar.
Not understanding what all this was about, Monkey turned back to ask the heavenly teachers, "What does it
mean?"
"When that wretch offended Heaven the Jade Emperor had these three things set up," the heavenly teachers
replied. "That place will only be due for rain when the chicken has eaten all the rice, the dog has licked up all
the flour, and the lamp has melted the bar of the lock."
When Monkey heard this he went pale with shock, and he dared make no more memorials to the throne. He
left the palace hall overcome with embarrassment. "Don't take it so badly, Great Sage," said the four heavenly
teachers with smiles. "This is something that can be resolved through goodness. Once a single kind thought
moves Heaven the rice and flour mountains will collapse and the bar of the padlock will be broken. If you can
persuade the marquis to return to goodness then blessings will come of themselves."
Monkey accepted their advice, and instead of going back to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to take his leave of
the Jade Emperor he headed straight down to the lower world and its ordinary mortals. Within an instant he
was at the Western Gate of Heaven, where he saw Heavenly King Lokapala again, who asked, "Did you get
the decree you wanted?" Monkey told him about the rice and flour mountains and the metal lock.
"What you said to me was quire right," he continued. "The Jade Emperor refuses to issue a decree. Just now
the heavenly teachers told me as they saw me off that the secret of blessings lay in persuading that so−and−so
to return to goodness." With that Monkey took his leave and went down to the lower world on his cloud.
When the marquis, Sanzang, Pig, Friar Sand and the officials high and low all welcomed him back they
crowded round him asking questions. Monkey then shouted at the marquis, "It's all because on the
twenty−fifth day of the twelfth month three years ago you offended Heaven and Earth that the people are
suffering, you wretch. That's why rain won't be sent now."
At this the marquis was so alarmed that he fell to his knees, prostrated himself on the ground and asked, "How
do you know about what happened three years ago, teacher?"
"Why did you knock the vegetarian offerings to Heaven over to feed to dogs?" said Monkey, "You'd better tell
me the truth."
Not daring to conceal anything, the marquis said, "On the twenty−fifth of the twelfth month three years ago I
was making offerings to Heaven within the palace. As my wife was wicked we quarreled and said bad things
to each other. In an unthinking outburst of fury I knocked over the table with the offerings and scattered the
vegetarian food. It's true that I called the dogs to eat it up. I never realized that Heaven would take offence at
this and harm the common people. For the last couple of years it has been preying on my mind. My thoughts
have been disturbed, and I haven't been able to understand why. I never realized that it was because Heaven
had taken offence that it was inflicting this disaster on the common people. Now that you have come down to
visit us, teacher, I beg you to enlighten me on what the upper world intends to do."
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1221
"That happened to be a day on which the Jade Emperor was visiting the lower world," Monkey replied.
"When he saw you feed the vegetarian food to the dogs and heard your foul language the Jade Emperor set
three things up to remember you by."
"What three things, brother?" Pig asked.
"In the Hall of Fragrance he had set up a rice mountain about a hundred feet high and a flour mountain about
two hundred feet high. Beside the rice mountain is a chicken the size of a fist who's eating it with quick pecks
and slow pecks. Beside the flour mountain is a golden−haired Pekinese licking the flour up with long licks
and short licks. And to the left is an iron frame from which hangs a golden padlock with a crossbar the
thickness of a finger under which a lamp is burning and warming the bar. You will only be due for rain here
when−the chicken's eaten all the rice, the dog's licked up all the flour and the lamp has melted the bar of the
lock."
"No problem," said Pig, "no problem. If you take me with you, brother, I can do a transformation, eat all the
rice and flour up in one sitting and snap the bar of the lock. I can guarantee rain."
"Don't talk nonsense, you idiot," said Monkey. "This is a plan that's been made by Heaven. You'll never be
able to get there."
"From what you say I don't know what to do," said Sanzang.
"It's easy," said Monkey, "easy. As I was leaving the four heavenly teachers said to me that this could only be
solved through goodness."
The marquis then prostrated himself on the ground again and said imploringly, "I will do just as you tell me,
teacher."
"If your heart can turn back to goodness," Monkey replied, "I hope that you'll at once start invoking the
Buddha and reciting scriptures. Then I'll be able to help you. If you persist in refusing to reform there'll be
nothing I can do to get you off. It won't be long before Heaven executes you, and your life will be beyond
saving."
The marquis kowtowed in worship, swearing to return to the faith. At once he summoned all the Buddhist and
Taoist clergy in the city and ordered that a site be prepared for religious ceremonies. They were all to write
out documents and memorials for three days. The marquis led his followers in burning incense and
worshipping, thanking Heaven and Earth and repenting of his sins. Sanzang recited surras on his behalf. At
the same time urgent notices were sent out ordering all the men and women, young and old, in all the
households inside and outside the city to burn incense sticks and invoke the Buddha. From that moment on all
ears were filled with virtuous sounds. Only then did Brother Monkey feel happy.
"You two look after the master," he said to Pig and Friar Sand, "while I go off for him again."
"Where are you going this time, brother?" Pig asked.
"The marquis really believed what I told him and is being reverent, good and kind," Monkey replied, "and he's
sincerely invoking the Buddha's name. So I'm going back to submit another request for rain to the Jade
Emperor."
"If you're going, don't lose any time, brother," said Friar Sand. "This is holding us up on our journey. But do
get a fall of rain: it'll be another true achievement for us."
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1222
The splendid Great Sage set his cloud off once more and went straight to the gate of Heaven, where he met
Heavenly King Lokapala again.
"What have you come for now?" Lokapala asked.
"The marquis has mended his ways," Monkey replied, which pleased the Heavenly King. As they were talking
the Straight Spell Messenger arrived at the gate of Heaven to deliver letters and documents written by Taoist
and Buddhist clergy.
When he saw Monkey the messenger bowed and said, "This is all the result of your successful conversion,
Great Sage."
"Where are you taking those letters?" Monkey asked.
"Straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness," the messenger replied, "to give to the heavenly teachers to pass
on to the Great Heavenly Honoured One, the Jade Emperor."
"In that case you'd better go first and I'll follow," Monkey said. The messenger then went in through the
heavenly gate. "Great Sage," said Heavenly King Lokapala, "there's no need for you to go to see the Jade
Emperor. You should go to borrow some thunder gods from the Office of Response to the Primary in the
Ninth Heaven, then set off thunder and lightning. After that there'll certainly be rain."
Monkey accepted this suggestion and went in through the gate of Heaven. Instead of going to the Hall of
Miraculous Mist to ask for an edict he at once turned his cloud−treading steps towards the Office of Response
to the Primary in the Ninth Heaven, where the Envoy of the Thunder Gate, the Corrector of Records and the
Inspector of Probity appeared to bow and say, "Why are you here, Great Sage?"
"There's something I'd like to see the Heavenly Honoured One about," Monkey replied, and the three envoys
passed this on in a memorial to the Heavenly Honoured One, who then came down from behind his screen of
red clouds and nine phoenixes in full court dress.
When they had exchanged greetings Monkey said, "There is something I would like to request of you."
"What might that be?" the Heavenly Honoured One asked.
"While escorting the Tang Monk I have reached the prefecture of Fengxian," said Brother Monkey, "and as
they have long been suffering from drought there I promised to make it rain for them. The reason I have come
here is to ask for the loan of some of your subordinate officials and generals in order to ask for rain."
"I am aware that three things have been set up because the marquis there offended Heaven," the Heavenly
Honoured One replied, "but I have not yet heard that rain is due to fall there."
"When I went to ask the Jade Emperor for an edict yesterday," Monkey replied with a smile, "he told the
heavenly teachers to take me to see the three things in the Hall of Fragrance: the mountain of rice, the
mountain of flour and the golden lock. Rain isn't due to fall till these three things have been knocked down or
broken. When I was feeling very upset because it was so difficult the heavenly teachers advised me to
persuade the marquis and his people to do good deeds because Heaven is bound to help anyone who has a
good thought. So there's a good chance of persuading Heaven to change its mind and delivering them from
this disaster. Now good thoughts are happening everywhere, and all ears are filled with good sounds. Not long
ago the Straight Spell Messenger took letters showing that they had mended their ways and turned towards
goodness to the Jade Emperor, which is why I've come to your illustrious palace to ask for the help of your
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1223
thunder officials and thunder generals."
"In that case," the Heavenly Honoured One replied, "I'll send Deng, Xin, Zhang and Tao to take Mother
Lightning and go with you to Fengxian Prefecture to make thunder, Great Sage."
Before long the four generals and the Great Sage had reached the boundaries of Fengxian and started
performing their magic in mid air. A great ramble of thunder could be heard, and there were sizzling flashes
of lightning. Indeed:
The lightning was like snakes of purple gold;
The thunder was like the noise of sleeping insects awakened.
Flashes of light like flying fire,
Thunderclaps like landslides in the mountains.
The jagged lines lit up the whole of the sky;
The great noise caused the earth itself to move.
When the red silk flashed like sprouts of plants
Rivers and mountains shook for three thousand miles.
Inside and outside the city of Fengxian nobody, whether an official high or how, a soldier or a civilian had
heard thunder or seen lightning for three whole years; and now that the thunder was booming and the
lightning flashing they all fell to their knees, put incense burners on their heads, held sprigs of willow in their
hands and said, "We submit to Amitabha Buddha. We submit to Amitabha Buddha." These good thoughts had
indeed moved Heaven, as is proved by an old−style poem:
When thoughts have been born in human minds
Heaven and earth will both be aware.
If evil and good do not get their due
Sides have been taken by powers up there.
We will for the moment leave the Great Sage Monkey directing the thunder generals as they unleashed
thunder and lightning over Fengxian Prefecture, where everyone had turned back to goodness, and tell how
the Straight Spell Messenger took the Taoist and Buddhist documents straight to the Hall of Universal
Brightness, where the four heavenly teachers submitted them to the Jade Emperor in the Hall of Miraculous
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1224
Mist.
When the Jade Emperor had seen them he said, "As that wretch has had some virtuous thoughts, see what has
happened to the three things." Just as he was speaking the official in charge of the Hall of Fragrance came in
to report, "The rice and flour mountains have collapsed: the rice and flour all disappeared in an instant. The
bar of the lock has also been broken."
Before he could finish submitting this memorial the heavenly official in attendance led in the local deity, the
city god and the gods of the altars from Fengxian, who all bowed and reported, "The lord of our prefecture
and every member of every household, high and low, of the people have been converted to the true
achievement and are worshipping the Buddha and Heaven. We now beg you in your compassion to send a
widespread fall of timely rain to deliver the common people."
When the Jade Emperor heard this he was very pleased, so he issued an edict: "Let the departments of wind,
cloud and rain go to the lower world in accordance with orders. At this hour on this day the clouds are to be
spread, the thunder shall roar, and three feet and forty−two drops of rain shall fall." At once the four heavenly
teachers transmitted the edict to the weather departments, who were all to go to the lower world, show their
powers and act together.
Monkey was enjoying himself up in the sky with Deng, Xin, Zhang and Tao, who were ordering Mother
Lightning about, when the arrival of all other gods filled the sky with their assembly. As the wind and the
clouds met, the timely rain began to pour down.
Thick, heavy clouds,
Lowering black mists,
The rumbling of the thunder cart,
The searing flash of lightning,
A roaring gale,
A torrential downpour.
Indeed, when one thought goes up to Heaven
Ten thousand hopes are all fulfilled.
Because the Great Sage has used his powers
The landscape is darkened for thousands of miles.
The wonderful rain falls like rivers and seas,
Hiding the country and heavens from sight.
Water comes pouring down the eaves,
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1225
Noisily pounding outside the windows.
While every household invokes the Buddha
All of the streets and markets are flooded.
To East and West every channel is filled;
Winding streams meander to North and to South.
Dried−up shoots receive moisture,
Withered trees revive.
The hemp and wheat now flourish in the fields;
Beans and other grains grow in the countryside.
Traders happily travel to sell their wares;
Cheerful peasants get ready to work.
After this the millet will do well,
And the crops are bound to yield a bumper harvest.
When wind and rain are timely the people know content;
When rivers and seas are calm the world is at peace.
That day three feet and forty−two drops of rain fell, after which all the gods began to tidy up and go away.
"Gods of the four departments," yelled the Great Sage at the top of his voice, "stay there for a moment with
your cloud followers while I tell the marquis to bow to you all and express his thanks. You may part the
clouds and appear in your true forms to let this mortal see you with his own eyes. That's the only way he'll
believe and make offerings." When the gods heard this they all stayed where they were up in the clouds.
Monkey then brought his cloud down to land and went straight into the prefectural palace, where Sanzang, Pig
and Friar Sand all greeted him. The marquis kowtowed to him in thanks at every pace he took.
"Stop thanking me," said Monkey. "I've asked the gods of the four departments to stay. Could you tell
everyone to come here to kowtow and thank them so that they'll make it rain properly in future?" The marquis
issued urgent orders summoning everyone to give thanks, and they all kowtowed with incense−sticks in their
hands. The gods of the four departments−−rain, thunder, cloud and wind−−then parted the clouds and
revealed themselves in their true form.
The dragon king appeared,
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1226
The thunder generals were revealed,
The clouds boys were seen,
The lords of the wind came down.
The dragon king appeared:
With silver whiskers and an azure face he was really peerless.
The thunder generals were revealed
With their countenances of matchless might and crooked mouths.
The cloud boys were seen
Wearing gold crowns over faces like jade.
The lords of the wind came down
With flustered brows and bulging eyes.
All were displayed on the azure clouds
Drawn up in ranks with their holy countenances.
Only then were the people of Fengxian convinced
As they kowtowed, burned incense and rejected evil.
Today they gazed up at the heavenly generals,
Washing their hearts as they all turned to goodness.
The gods stood there for two hours as the people kowtowed to them endlessly. Monkey rose up into the
clouds again to bow to all the gods and say, "I've put you to great trouble. All you gentlemen may now return.
I'll make everyone in this prefecture give pure and lofty offerings to thank you at the due season. From now
on you gentlemen must send wind every five days and rain every ten days to help them out." The gods all
consented as he told them and returned to their own departments.
Bringing his cloud down to land, Monkey said to Sanzang, "Now that the job's been done and the people
given peace we can pack our things and be on our way again."
When the marquis heard this he hastened to bow and say, "How can you say such a thing, Lord Sun? What
has happened today has been an infinitely great act of kindness. I have sent people to prepare a humble
banquet to thank you for your great kindness. Then I will buy some land from the people to build a monastery
for you, my lords, with a shrine to you with inscribed tablets where offerings can be made in all four seasons.
Even if I were to carve my own bones and heart it would be hard to repay a ten thousandth part of what I owe
you. You can't possibly leave."
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1227
"What Your Excellency says is very fine," Sanzang replied, "but we are pilgrim monks who can only put up
for the night on our journey West. We cannot stay here long. We definitely must leave in a day or two." The
marquis refused to let them go, and he ordered many people to prepare a banquet and start building a
monastery that very night.
The next day there was a magnificent banquet at which the Tang Priest took the place of honour while the
Great Sage Monkey sat beside him with Pig and Friar Sand. The marquis and his officials high and low
passed them cups of wine and dishes of food while fine music was played, and so they were entertained all
day. It was a most happy occasion, and there is a poem to prove it:
After long drought the fields received sweet rain;
Merchants were travelling along all watercourses.
They were deeply moved by the monks who had come to the city,
And by the Great Sage who had gone up to Heaven.
The three things had now been accomplished;
One thought had brought all back to the good.
From now on all longed for a new golden age
With ideal weather and good harvests for ever.
The banquets went on for days, as did the giving of thanks, until they had been kept there for almost half a
month. All that remained to do was complete the monastery and the shrine. One day the marquis invited the
four monks to go to inspect them.
"How did you complete so enormous a project so quickly?" asked the Tang Priest in astonishment.
"I pressed the laborers to work night and day without stopping and insisted most urgently that they finish
quickly," the marquis replied. "Now I would like you gentlemen to come and inspect it."
"You certainly are a most good and able marquis," said Monkey with a smile. By now they had all reached the
new monastery, where they were full of admiration for the towering halls and the majestic entrance. Monkey
asked Sanzang to name the monastery.
"Very well," Sanzang said, "I name it the Monastery of Salvation by Timely Rain."
"Splendid," said the marquis, "splendid." He then issued a golden invitation to monks from far and wide to
come to burn incense there. To the left of the Buddha hall was a shrine to the four pilgrims at which offerings
were to be made in each of the four seasons every year. Temples had also been built for the thunder gods and
dragon gods to thank them for their divine efforts. When the visit was over Sanzang ordered an early
departure.
Journey to the West
Chapter 87 1228
When the local people realized that the monks could be persuaded to stay no longer they all prepared parting
gifts, none of which the travelers would accept. Then all the officials in the prefecture escorted them on their
way for ten miles with a band playing and a great display of flags and canopies. Still loath to let the travelers
go, the officials watched with tears in their eyes till they had disappeared from sight. Only then did the
officials return to the city. Indeed:
The virtuous and holy monk left behind the Salvation Monastery;
The Great Sage Equaling Heaven dispensed great kindness.
If you don't know how many more days after this departure it was that they finally saw the Tathagata Buddha,
listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 88
When the Dhyana Reaches Yuhua a Display of Magic Is Given
The Mind−Ape and the Mother of Wood Take Their Own Disciples
The story tells how after happily taking their leave of the marquis the Tang Priest turned to Monkey as he rode
and said, "Worthy disciple, this good result was even better than rescuing the babies in Bhiksuland, and it was
all your achievement."
"In Bhiksuland you only saved 1,111 little boys," said Friar Sand. "That's no comparison with this heavy,
soaking rain that's saved tens of thousands of lives. I've been quietly admiring my big brother's magical
powers that extend right up to the heavens, as well as his mercy that covers the whole earth."
"Merciful and good our big brother may be," said Pig with a laugh, "but it's just a show of being kind. Inside
he's a troublemaker. When he's with me he treats me like dirt."
"When have I ever treated you like dirt?" Monkey protested. "Often enough," replied Pig. "You're always
seeing to it that I get tied up, hung up, boiled and steamed. After being so kind to all those tens of thousands
of people in Fengxian you should have stayed there for half a year and let me have a few more good filling
meals. Why did you have to be sending us on our way?"
When the venerable elder heard this he shouted, "You idiot! Can you think of nothing but your greed? Stop
quarrelling and be on your way." Daring say no more, Pig thrust out his snout, shouldered the luggage, and
followed the master and his fellow disciples along the road, laughing loudly.
Time moved as fast as a shuttle, and soon it was late autumn. What could be seen was,
The end of ripples on the waters,
The mountains' bones looking lean.
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1229
Red leaves fly around,
In the time of yellowing flowers.
Under the clear and frosty sky the nights seem longer;
The moon shines white through the windows.
Many the household fires in the evening light;
The water gleams cold all over the lake.
The clover fern is now white,
While knotweed blooms red.
Mandarins are green and oranges yellow;
Willows are withering and the millet is ripe.
Beside the desolate village wild geese land among the reeds;
Cocks call by the country inn while the beans are harvested.
When the four of them had been travelling for a long time they saw the towering shape of a city wall.
"Wukong," said Sanzang, waving his riding−crop, "you can see there's another city there. I wonder where it
is."
"Neither of us have ever been here before," Monkey replied, "so how could I know? Let's go ahead and ask."
Before the words were out of his mouth an old man appeared from among some trees. He was leaning on a
stick, lightly dressed with coconut sandals on his feet and had a sash round his waist. The Tang Priest hastily
dismounted and went over to greet the old man.
Returning his greeting as he leaned on his stick, the old man asked, "Where are you from, reverend sir?"
"I am a poor monk sent by the Tang court in the East to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and
fetch the scriptures," the Tang Priest replied, putting his hands together in front of his chest. "Now that I have
come to this distinguished place I wonder which city it is that I can see in the distance, and I would ask you,
venerable benefactor, to inform me."
When the old man heard this he replied, "Enlightened master of the dhyana, this humble place of ours is
Yuhua County in one of the prefectures of India. The lord of our city is a member of the king of India's royal
family who has been made prince of Yuhua. He is a very worthy prince who respects both Buddhist and
Taoist clergy and cares deeply for the common people. If you go to see him he will certainly treat you with
great respect." Sanzang thanked the old man, who went off through the woods.
Sanzang then turned back to tell his disciples what had happened. The three of them were happily going to
help the master back on his horse when Sanzang said, "It's not far. There is no need to ride." The four of them
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1230
then walked to a street beside the city wall to take a look. This was an area where traders lived; it was
crowded with people and business was good. The people looked and sounded no different from those of
China. "Be careful, disciples," said Sanzang. "On no account must you act wild."
At that Pig bowed his head and Friar Sand covered his face, leaving only Monkey to support the master. On
both sides of the road people were crowding in to look at them, shouting, "We only have eminent monks who
subdue dragons and tigers here. We've never seen monks who subdue pigs and monkeys before." This was
more than Pig could stand.
Thrusting his snout at them he said, "Have you ever seen a monk in all your life who subdued the king of the
pigs?" This gave all the people in the street so bad a fright that they fell back on both sides of them stumbling
and tripping over, trying to get away.
"Put that snout away at once, you idiot," said Monkey with a grin, "and don't try to make yourself look pretty.
Just pay attention while you're crossing the bridge." The idiot lowered his head and kept grinning. Once over
the drawbridge they entered the city, where the main roads were bustling and prosperous with bars and houses
of entertainment. It was indeed a city in a divine region, and there is a poem to prove it that goes,
An eternally iron−strong city like splendid brocade,
Full of fresh color, lying next to a river near mountains,
Connected by boat with lakes for the movement of goods.
A thousand wine−shops await behind curtains.
Everywhere smoke rises from towering buildings;
Each morning the lanes are filled with the hubbub of traders.
The look of the city was much like Chang'an:
Cock−crows and the barking of dogs were all just the same.
"I have heard tell of the foreigners in the West," Sanzang thought with secret delight, "but I have never come
here before. On close examination it is no different from our Great Tang. This must be what is meant by
paradise." When he learned that a bushel of hulled rice cost only four tenths of an ounce of silver and a pound
of sesame oil only eight thousandths of an ounce of silver he realized that this truly was a place where crops
grew in abundance.
After walking for quite a long time they reached the prince of Yuhua's palace. On either side of the palace
gates were the office of the remembrancer, the law courts, the prince's kitchens and the government hostel.
"Disciples," said Sanzang, "here is the palace. Wait while I go inside for the prince to inspect our passport and
let us on our way."
"We can't very well stand at the gates while you go in, Master," said Pig.
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1231
"Can you not see 'Government Hostel' written over that gateway?" Sanzang asked. "Go and sit there and see if
you can buy some fodder for the horse. If the prince offers me a meal when I have my audience with him I
will send for you to share it."
"Go on in, Master, and don't worry," said Brother Monkey. "I can cope." Friar Sand carried the luggage into
the hostel, where the staff were so alarmed by their hideous faces that they did not dare ask them any
questions or send them away but could only invite them to sit down.
Meanwhile the master changed his habit and hat and went straight into the prince's palace with the passport in
his hands. Soon he was met by a protocol officer who asked, "Where are you from, reverend sir?"
"I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the
Great Thunder Monastery," Sanzang replied. "Now that I have reached this distinguished place I would like to
have my passport inspected and returned, which is why I have come to seek an audience with His Royal
Highness." The protocol officer passed this on, and as the prince was indeed an enlightened one he sent for
Sanzang at once.
Sanzang bowed in greeting before the prince's hall, and the prince invited him into the hall to sit down. When
the prince read the passport that Sanzang handed him and saw the seals and signatures from so many countries
on it he signed it himself, folded it up and put it on his table. "Venerable Teacher of the Nation," he said, "you
have passed through many countries on your way here from Great Tang. How long has your journey taken?"
"I have kept no record of the distance," Sanzang said, "but some years ago the Boddhisattva Guanyin
appeared to me and left an address in verse in which it was said that the road would be sixty thousand miles
long. I have already seen fourteen winters and summers on my journey."
"That means fourteen years," the prince replied. "I should imagine that there were many delays along the
way."
"It would be hard to tell of them all," said Sanzang. "There were thousands of monsters and I don't know how
much suffering to be endured before I could reach here." The prince was so pleased with his visitor that he
ordered his kitchens to prepare a vegetarian meal for him.
"I wish to inform Your Royal Highness that I have three disciples," Sanzang said. "As they are waiting
outside I will not be able to delay our journey by accepting the meal." The prince then ordered his aides to go
straight out to invite the venerable elder's three disciples into the palace to share the meal.
When the aides went out with this invitation they said, "We can't see them, we can't see them."
"There are three hideous monks sitting in the hostel," one of their staff said. "Must be them."
The aides and their staff then went to the hostel, where they asked the people in charge, "Which are the
disciples of the monk from Great Tang who's going to fetch the scriptures? His Royal Highness has invited
them to a meal."
As soon as Pig, who was sitting there snoozing, heard the word "meal" he could not help jumping up and
saying, "We are, we are," at the sight of which the palace aides' souls flew from their bodies as they shivered
and said, "A pig demon! A pig demon!"
When Monkey heard this he seized hold of Pig and said, "Act a bit more civilized, brother, and don't be so
wild." When the officials saw Monkey they all said, "A monkey spirit! A monkey spirit!"
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1232
"There's no need to be frightened," said Friar Sand, raising his hands together in polite greeting. "We're all
disciples of the Tang Priest."
"A stove god, a stove god," was the officials' reaction to the sight of him. Monkey then told Pig to lead the
horse and Friar Sand to shoulder the carrying−pole as they followed the officials' staff into the prince of
Yuhua's palace. The aides went ahead to announce them.
When the prince looked up and saw how ugly they were he too was frightened. "Do not be alarmed, Your
Royal Highness," said Sanzang, putting his hands together in front of his chest. "Although my rough disciples
are ugly they have good hearts."
Pig intoned a noise of respect and said, "How do you do?" This made the prince feel even more alarmed.
"All my rough disciples are from the wilds and the mountains and they do not know how to behave," Sanzang
explained, "so please forgive them." Overcoming his fear, the prince told the superintendent of his kitchens to
take the monks to eat in the Gauze Pavilion.
Sanzang thanked the prince, came down from the hall to proceed to the pavilion with his disciples, then
grumbled at Pig, "You idiot," he said, "you've not a shred of manners. If you had kept your mouth shut that
would have been fine, but why did you have to be so coarse? That one remark from you was enough to knock
a mountain over."
"I did better by not making a respectful chant," said Monkey, "and I saved a bit of my breath too."
"You didn't even intone the chant properly," said Friar Sand to Pig. "First of all, you stuck your snout out and
roared."
"It makes me hopping mad," said Pig. "The other day the master told me that the polite thing when I met
someone was to say, 'How do you do?' I do it today and you tell me it's wrong. How do you want me to
behave?"
"I told you to say, 'How do you do?' when you meet people," Sanzang replied, "but not to make such a fool of
yourself when you meet a prince. As the saying goes, things, like people, come in grades. Why can't you see
the differences of social rank?" While he was still making these remarks the superintendent of the kitchens led
servants in to set out tables and chairs and serve the vegetarian feast. Then the monks stopped talking and
started eating their meal.
When the prince withdrew from the palace hall to his living quarters his three sons noticed his pallor and
asked, "What has given you such a fright today, Father?"
"A most remarkable monk has arrived," the prince replied. "He has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to
worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures, and he came to present his passport. When I invited him to take a
meal he told me that he had some disciples outside the palace, so I asked them in. When they came in a
moment later they didn't kowtow to me but just said, 'How do you do?' That was upsetting enough. Then
when I looked at them I saw that they were all as ugly as demons, which gave me quite a shock. That's why
I'm looking pale."
Now the three young princes were no ordinary boys. They were all fond of the martial arts, so they stretched
out their hands, rolled up their sleeves and said, "They must be evil spirits from the mountains disguised as
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1233
humans. Wait while we fetch our weapons and take a look at them."
Splendid young princes! The eldest wielded a brow−high rod, the second a nine−toothed rake and the third a
black−painted cudgel, and the three of them strode with great valour and spirit out of the palace, shouting,
"What's this about monks fetching scriptures? Where are they?"
"Young prince," replied the superintendent of the kitchens and the others on their knees, "they're eating in the
Gauze Pavilion."
The young princes then charged straight in without stopping to think as they shouted, "Are you men or
monsters? Tell us at once and we'll spare your lives."
This gave Sanzang such a fright that he turned pale, dropped his bowl, bowed to them and replied, "I have
come from Great Tang to fetch the scriptures. I am a man, not a monster."
"You look human enough," the princes said, "but the three ugly ones are definitely monsters."
Pig kept eating and ignored them, while Friar Sand and Monkey bowed and said, "We're all human. Our faces
may be ugly but our hearts are good, and despite our clumsy bodies we have good natures. Where are you
three from, and why are you shooting your mouths off so wildly?"
"These three gentlemen are His Royal Highness's sons," explained the superintendent of the kitchens and the
others who were standing at the side of the pavilion.
"Well, Your Highnesses," said Pig, throwing down his bowl, "what are you carrying those weapons for? Do
you want a fight with us?"
The second prince strode forward wielding his rake in both hands to strike at Pig, which made him say with a
chuckle, "That rake of yours is only fit to be the grandson of my one." With that he stripped down, pulled his
own rake out from his belt and swung it, making ten thousand beams of golden light, then went through some
movements, leaving a thousand strands of auspicious vapor. The second prince was so terrified that his hands
went weak and his muscles turned numb and he lost the nerve for any more showing off.
When Monkey saw that the oldest of the young princes was leaping about with a brow−high rod he brought
his own gold−banded cudgel out from his ear and shook it to make it as thick as a bowl and twelve or thirteen
feet long. Ramming it into the ground, he made a hole about three feet deep in which it stood upright, then
said with a smile, "I'm giving you this cudgel."
As soon as the prince heard this he threw his own rod down and went to take the cudgel, but though he pulled
at it with all his strength he couldn't move it by as much as a hair's breath. Then he straightened himself up
and shook it, but it was as if it had taken root. At this the third prince started acting wild, moving into the
attack with his black−painted cudgel. Friar Sand dodged the blow, then brought out his own demon−quelling
staff, and as he fingered it brilliant light and glowing, coloured clouds came from it, leaving the
superintendent of the kitchens and the rest of them wide−eyed and speechless. The three young princes then
kowtowed, saying, "Divine teachers, divine teachers, we mere mortals failed to recognize you. We beg you to
give us a display of your powers."
Monkey went up to them, effortlessly picked up his cudgel and said, "It's too cramped here for me to do my
stuff. I'm jumping up into the auto play around and give you something to see."
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1234
The splendid Great Sage went whistling up by somersault and stood on an auspicious cloud of many colours
up in mid−air about three hundred feet above the ground. Then he moved up and down and spun to left and
right as he performed a Canopy from Which Flowers Are Scattered and a Twisting Dragon with his
gold−banded club. At first both he and the cudgel moved like flowers being added to brocade, but later he
could no longer be seen as the whole sky was filled with the whirling cudgel.
As he roared his approval from down below Pig could not keep still, and with a great shout of "I'm going to
have a bit of fun too!" the splendid idiot rode a breeze up into the air and started swinging his rake. He went
three times up, four times down, five times to the left, six times to the right, seven times forwards and eight
times backwards as he ran through all the movements he knew, filling the air with a noise like a howling gale.
Just when he had warmed up Friar Sand said to Sanzang, "Master, let me go up and give a show too."
Springing up into the air with both feet, the splendid monk whirled his club through the air, which glittered
with golden light. Wielding his demon−subduing cudgel he performed a Red Phoenix Facing the Sun and a
Hungry Tiger Seizing Its Prey, attacking hard and defending with time to spare as he turned for a sudden
forward thrust. The three brother disciples all gave a most imposing display of their magical powers. This was
indeed
An image of the dhyana, no common sight;
The causation of the Great Way filling all of space.
Metal and wood fill the dharma−world with their might;
A pinch of elixir produces perfect unity.
The quality of these magic warriors is often displayed;
The splendor of their weapons is widely revered.
Lofty though India is,
The princes of Yuhua now return to the central truth.
This all so terrified the three young princes that they fell to their knees in the dust; and all the staff in the
Gauze Pavilion, high and low, together with the senior prince in his palace, all the soldiers, civilians, men and
women, Buddhist monks and nuns, Taoist clergy, lay people−−everyone in fact−−all invoked the Buddha,
kowtowed, held sticks of incense and worshipped. Indeed:
All the monks were converted at the sight of the true images,
Bringing blessings to mankind and the joys of peace.
From here the achievement was won on the road to enlightenment;
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1235
All joined in meditation and worshipped the Buddha.
When the three of them had given a display of their heroic powers they brought their auspicious clouds down
to land, put their weapons away, joined their hands together in homage to the Tang Priest, thanked him and
took their seats again.
The three young princes hurried back into the palace to report to their father, "A most wonderful thing has
happened, Father. Today has been a tremendous success. Did you see the performance in the sky just now?"
"When I saw the coloured clouds glowing in the sky a little while back I, your mother and everyone else in the
inner palace burned incense and worshipped," the prince, their father, replied. "I don't know where the gods or
immortals who had gathered there were from."
"They weren't gods and immortals from somewhere else," the young princes said. "They were the three
hideous disciples of the monk who's going to fetch the scriptures. One of them uses a gold−banded iron
cudgel, one a nine−toothed take, and one a demon−quelling staff, all exactly the same as our three weapons.
When we asked them to give us a display they said it was too cramped down here to be able to manage, so
they'd go up into the sky to give us a show. Then they all went up on clouds, filling the sky with auspicious
clouds and vapors. They only came down a moment ago, and they're now sitting in the Gauze Pavilion. We
are all very taken with them and we'd like to make them our teachers and learn their skills to protect the
country with. This really will be an enormous achievement. I wonder what Your Majesty thinks." When the
prince, their father, heard this he was convinced and agreed.
Father and sons then went straight to the Gauze Pavilion, going on foot instead of by carriage, and without
any parasols. The four travelers had by now packed up their luggage and were just about to go to the palace to
thank the prince for the meal and start out on their journey again when they saw the prince of Yuhua and his
sons come into the pavilion and prostrate themselves before them. The venerable elder hurriedly rose and
prostrated himself to return the courtesy, while Monkey and the rest of them moved aside with a hint of a
mocking grin. When the kowtowing was over the four travelers were happy to go into the palace on being
invited to do so and take seats of honour.
Then the senior prince got up and said, "Tang Master, there is one thing I would like to ask of you, but I do
not know whether your three illustrious disciples will grant it."
"My disciples will obey any instruction that Your Royal Highness gives them," Sanzang replied.
"When I first saw you gentlemen," said the prince, "I took you for pilgrim monks from distant Tang, and
because I am a mere mortal with fleshly eyes I treated you in a most offhand way. It was only when I saw
Teacher Sun, Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand whirling around in the sky that I realized you are immortals and
Buddhas. My three wretched sons have been fond of the martial arts all their lives and they now wish most
sincerely to be accepted as your disciples and learn some of your skills. I beg that in the greatness of your
hearts you will agree to be the salvation of my boys. I will certainly reward you with all the wealth of the
city."
When Brother Monkey heard this he could not restrain himself from replying with a chuckle, "You really
don't understand, Your Royal Highness. As monks we'd love to have disciples, and your fine sons have their
hearts set on goodness. But you mustn't talk about material benefits. As long as they can get on with us we'll

Chapter 88 1236
look after them." This delighted the prince, who ordered a great banquet in the main hall of the palace. It was
amazing: no sooner had he issued his order than everything was there. This is what could be seen:
Fluttering silken decorations,
Darkly fragrant incense smoke.
Gold−inlaid tables hung with knotted silks,
Dazzling the eyes;
Lacquered chairs with cushions of brocade,
Making them even more splendid.
Fresh fruit,
Fragrant tea.
Three or four courses of pure confectioneries,
One or two servings of rich and pure breadrolls.
The crisp steamed honeycakes were even finer;
The deep−fried sweets were truly delicious.
There were jugs of mild rice−wine,
Better than nectar when poured;
Servings of Yangxian tea that is fit for immortals,
More fragrant than cassia when held in the hands.
Every possible dish is provided;
All that is offered is outstanding.
Meanwhile there was singing, dancing, instrumental music, acrobatics and opera to entertain them. Master,
disciples, the prince and his sons all had a day of delight, and after night fell unnoticed they dispersed. The
princes then had beds and curtains set up in the pavilion and invited their teachers to turn in for the night;
early the next morning they would piously burn incense and call on them again to ask them to teach their
martial skills. These orders were obeyed, and hot, scented water was brought in for the travelers to bath in,
after which everyone went to bed. At that time
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1237
The birds perched high in the trees and all was silent;
The poet came down from his couch to end his chanting.
The light of the Milky Way now filled the sky,
And the grass grew thicker along the overgrown path.
The bang of a washing stick came from another courtyard;
The distant mountains and passes made one long for home.
The chirp of crickets expressed people's feelings,
Chirruping at the bedside interrupted one's dreams.
That describes the night. Early the next morning the prince and his three sons came to call on the venerable
elder again. The previous day they had greeted each other with the etiquette appropriate to a prince, but
today's greetings were those appropriate to teachers.
The three young princes kowtowed to Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, then asked with bows, "Will you let your
disciples have a look at your weapons, honoured teachers?" As soon as Pig heard this request he happily
brought out his iron rake and threw it on the ground, while Friar Sand tossed his staff against the wall. The
second and third young princes sprang to their feet to pick them up, but they might just as well have been
dragonflies trying to shake a stone pillar: they both strained themselves till they were red in the face without
moving the weapons in the slightest. When their elder brother saw this he said, "Don't waste your efforts,
brothers. Our teachers' weapons are all magical ones. Goodness only knows how heavy they are."
"My rake's not all that heavy," said Pig with a smile. "It only weighs a couple of tons−−5,048 pounds
including the handle."
The third prince then asked Friar Sand how heavy his staff was. "It's 5,048 pounds too," replied Friar Sand
with a smile.
The oldest of the young princes then asked Brother Monkey to let him see the gold−banded cudgel. Monkey
produced the needle from his ear, shook it in the wind to make it as thick as a rice bowl, and stood it upright
in the ground in front of him, to the consternation and alarm of all the princes and officials. The three young
princes then kowtowed again and said, "Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand carry their weapons under their
clothes where they can get them out. Why do you take yours out of your ear, Teacher Sun? How do you make
it grow in the wind?"
"You wouldn't realize that this isn't some mere mortal object," Monkey replied.
"When chaos was first parted the iron was cast:
Yu the Great had the work done himself.
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1238
When he unified the depths of rivers, lakes and seas
This cudgel served as a measuring rod.
In the prosperity after mountains and seas had been ordered
It floated to the gates of the Eastern Ocean.
Over the years it gave off a coloured glow,
Learned to shrink and to grow and shine with pure light.
It was my destiny to recover this rod
Which endlessly changes when I say the spell.
When I tell it to grow it fills the universe,
But it can be as tiny as a needle's eye.
It's known as As−You−Will and called gold−banded;
In Heaven and on Earth it is quite unique.
Its weight is thirteen thousand and five hundred pounds;
Whether thick or fine it can bring life or death.
Once it helped me make havoc in Heaven,
And took part when I attacked the Underworld.
It always succeeds in subduing dragons and tigers,
Everywhere wipes out monsters and ogres.
If it points up the sun goes dark;
Heaven, earth, gods, devils, all are afraid.
Passed on by magic since the birth of time,
This is no ordinary piece of iron."
When the young princes had heard this they all started kowtowing endlessly, bowing over and over again as
they earnestly begged for instruction.
"Which fighting skills do the three of you want to learn?" Monkey asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1239
"The one of us who uses a rod wants to learn that," the young princes replied, "the one who fights with a rake
wants to learn the rake, and the staff man wants to learn the staff."
"Teaching would be easy enough," replied Monkey with a smile, "except that you're all too weak to be able to
use our weapons, so you won't be able to master them. 'A badly−drawn tiger only looks like a dog.' As they
used to say in the old days, 'If the teaching isn't strict it shows the teacher is idle; if the student doesn't learn
it's his own fault.' If you're really sincere you'd better burn incense and bow to Heaven and Earth. I'll give you
some magic strength before teaching you how to fight."
The three young princes were very pleased to hear him say this, and they at once carried in an incense table
themselves, washed their hands, lit incense sticks and bowed to Heaven. This done, they asked their teachers
to instruct them.
Monkey stepped down and said to the Tang Priest with a bow, "Please forgive your disciple, honoured
Master. Ever since in your goodness you rescued me at the Double Boundary Mountain and I became a
Buddhist all those years ago we've been travelling West. Although I've never done very much to repay your
kindness I have crossed plenty of rivers and mountains and done everything I possibly could. Now that we've
come to this land of the Buddha and had the good fortune of meeting these three young princes, they've taken
us as their teachers of martial arts. As our pupils they'd be your pupils' pupils, so I ask you respectfully,
Master, to allow us to instruct them."
Sanzang was delighted, and when Pig and Friar Sand saw Monkey bowing to him they kowtowed too and
said, "Master, we're stupid and too awkward with words to be able to explain things properly. Please take your
dharma seat and let each of us take a pupil. It'll be fun, and something to remind us of our journey West."
Sanzang was happy to agree.
Monkey then took the three young princes into a quiet room behind the pavilion where he drew a star−chart of
the Dipper and told them to prostrate themselves inside it while they shut their eyes and settled their spirits.
Meanwhile he silently said the words of the spell, recited a mantra, and blew magic breath into the hearts of
the three of them. He put their primal spirits back into their original home, taught them magical spells, gave
each of them immense strength, applied the right heat, and performed a magic that replaced their old bodies
and bones with new ones. After the heat circulated in a roundabout way through their bodies the three young
princes came to, stood up, rubbed their faces, summoned up their spirits, and all found that they were much
stronger. The eldest of them could pick up the gold−banded cudgel, the second could swing the nine−toothed
rake, and the third could raise the demon−quelling staff.
When the king saw this he was beside himself with delight, and arranged another vegetarian feast for the Tang
Priest and his three disciples. In front of the banquet each of the princes was taught his own skill: the one who
was learning the rod practised with the rod, the one who was learning the rake practised with the rake, and the
one who was learning the staff practised with the staff. Though the young princes did manage a few turns and
movements it took a lot of effort, and going through a series of movements left them gasping for breath, so
that they could not go on. Besides this, the weapons they were using had the power of transformation, so that
as the princes advanced, retreated, attacked and lifted the weapons shrunk, grew and went through amazing
changes by themselves. But the princes were, after all, only mortals, and were unable to keep up with the
speed of their weapons. Later that day the banquet came to an end.
The next day the three princes came back once more to express their thanks and say, "We are very grateful to
you, divine teachers, for giving us this strength, but when we try to spin your divine weapons around we can
only move them with great difficulty. We would like to get smiths to make lighter copies of them, but we
don't know whether you would agree to that, Teachers."
Journey to the West
Chapter 88 1240
"Great, great," said Pig. "That's the way to talk. You ought to have your own made because you can't use our
weapons, and anyhow we need them to protect the Dharma and beat monsters." The princes then sent for
smiths who bought ten thousand pounds of iron and steel, set up a workshop with a furnace in the front
courtyard of the prince's palace, and began to cast the weapons. On the first day the steel was made, and on
the second Monkey and the other two were asked to bring out their gold−banded cudgel, nine−toothed rake
and demon−quelling staff and put them under the matting shelter to be copied. The work went on by night and
day without stopping.
These weapons were the treasures they always carried with them that they could not be parted from for a
moment. Normally they hid them about their persons. Now the weapons were protected by coloured light, so
that when they were put in the yard of the workshop for several days many beams of radiance reached up to
the heavens, while every kind of auspicious vapor blanketed the earth. That night an evil spirit, who was
sitting out on a night watch in a cave called Tigermouth Cave on a mountain called Mount Leopard Head that
was only some twenty−five miles from the city, noticed the glow and the auspicious vapors.
Going up on his cloud to investigate he saw that the light came from the city, whereupon he brought his cloud
down and went closer for a better look. Discovering that the light was coming from the weapons, he thought
with delight and desire, "What wonderful weapons, what splendid treasures. I wonder whose they are and why
they've been left here. This must be my lucky chance. I'll take them, I'll take them." His covetousness now
moved, he created a mighty wind, scooped up all three weapons and took them back to his cave. Indeed:
Not for one moment must the Way be left;
What can be left is not the true Way.
Cultivation and trance will both be in vain
When divine arms have been taken away.
If you do not know how these weapons were found, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 89

Metal, Wood and Earth Make Havoc on Mount Leopard Head
The story tells how after days on end of hard work the smiths all went to sleep that night, only to get up at
dawn to start again and find that the three weapons had disappeared from under the matting shelter.
Dumbfounded with horror, they started looking for them everywhere, and when the three young princes came
out of the inner quarters to watch, the smiths all kowtowed to them and said, "Young masters, we don't know
where the divine teachers' three weapons have all gone."
When the young princes heard this news they trembled and said, "We expect our masters put them away last
night." Rushing to the Gauze Pavilion, they found the white horse still tethered in the walkway and could not
help shouting, "Teachers, are you still asleep?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1241
"We're up," Friar Sand replied, and opened the door of their room to let the young princes in.
When they saw that the weapons were not there they asked with alarm, "Masters, have you put your weapons
away?"
"No," replied Monkey, springing up.
"The three weapons disappeared during the night," the princes explained.
"Is my rake still there?" Pig asked as he scrambled to his feet.
"When we came out a moment ago we saw everyone searching for them," the princes replied. "When they
couldn't find them we wondered if you had put them away, which is why we came to ask. As your treasures
can shrink or grow we wonder if you've hidden them about yourselves to play a trick on us."
"Honestly, we haven't," said Monkey. "Let's all join the search."
When they went to the matting shelter in the yard and could see that there really was no sign of the weapons
Pig said, "You smiths must have stolen them. Bring'em out at once. Do it right now or I'll kill you. I'll kill you,
I say."
The smiths kowtowed desperately and said with tears pouring down their faces, "Your Lordships, we went to
sleep last night because we'd been working so hard for days on end. When we got up this morning they'd
gone. We're only ordinary mortals. We could never have moved them. Spare our lives, Your Lordships, spare
our lives."
Monkey said with bitter regret, "It's our fault. After we'd shown them what they look like to copy we should
have kept them on us instead of leaving them lying there. I suppose our treasures' glowing clouds and light
must have alerted some monster who came and stole them during the night."
"Nonsense, brother," Pig replied. "This is a peaceful, orderly sort of place, not somewhere in the wilds or the
mountains. No monsters could possibly have come here. I'm sure it was those evil smiths who stole our
weapons. They could tell they were treasures from the light shining from them. They must have left the palace
last night and got a whole gang together to carry or drag them out. Bring'em here! I'm going to hit them." The
smiths kowtowed and swore to their innocence for all they were worth.
Amid all this commotion the senior prince came out, and when he asked what had happened the color drained
from his face too. After muttering to himself in a low voice for a while he said, "Divine teachers, your
weapons were not mere mortals' ones. Even if there had been a hundred or more people they would never
have been able to move them. Besides, my family has been ruling this city for five generations. I'm not
boasting, but I do have a certain reputation for being a good man. The soldiers, civilians and artisans who live
here fear my laws, and I am certain that they could never have had so wicked an idea. I hope that you divine
teachers will think again."
"No need for any more thinking about it," replied Brother Monkey with a smile, "and no need to make the
smiths suffer for what's not their fault. I would like to ask Your Royal Highness if there are any evil monsters
in the mountains and forests around the city."
"That's a very good question," the prince replied. "There is a mountain North of the city called Mount Leopard
Head, with a Tigermouth Cave in it. People often say that immortals, or tigers and wolves, or evil spirits live
there. As I've never been there to find out the truth I am not sure what kind of creatures there are."
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1242
"No need to say any more," replied Monkey with a laugh. "It must be someone wicked from there who knew
they were treasures and came during the night to steal them. Pig, Friar Sand," he ordered, "stay here to guard
the master and the city while I go for a look round." He then told the smiths to keep the furnace burning and
carry on forging the new weapons.
The splendid Monkey King took his leave of Sanzang and whistled out of sight. Soon he was on Mount
Leopard Head, which took him but an instant as it was only ten miles from the city. As he climbed to the
summit to look around he saw that there was quite an air of evil about it. Indeed, it was
A long dragon chain of hills,
A mighty formation.
Sharp peaks thrusting into the sky,
Streams flowing fast along chasms deep.
In front of the mountain grow cushions of rare plants;
Behind the mountain strange flowers form brocade.
Tall pine and ancient cypress,
Old trees and find bamboo.
Crows and magpies sing as they fly,
Cranes call and gibbons scream.
Below the beetling scar
David's deer go in twos;
In front of the sheer rock−face
Are pairs of badgers and foxes.
Dragons from afar emerge briefly from the waters
Of the twisting, winding stream that runs deep under the ground.
This ridge runs right to the edge of Yuhua,
A place of beauty for a thousand ages.
Just as he was surveying the scene Monkey heard voices on the other side of the mountain, turned quickly
round to look, and saw a couple of wolf−headed ogres climbing towards the Northwest and talking loudly as
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1243
they went.
"They must be monsters patrolling the mountain," Monkey guessed. "I'm going to listen to what they have to
say."
Making magic with his hands and saying the words of a spell Monkey shook himself, turned into a butterfly,
spread his wings and fluttered after them. It was a very lifelike transformation:
A pair of powdery wings,
Two silver antennae.
In the wind it files very fast;
In the sun it's a leisurely dancer.
It crosses rivers and walls in a flash.
Enjoys stealing fragrance and playing with catkins.
This delicate creature loves the taste of fresh flowers
It shows its beauty and elegance as it pleases.
He flew to a spot right above the evil spirits' heads, where he floated and listened to what they had to say.
"Brother," one of them shouted suddenly, "our chief keeps on striking it lucky. The other month he caught
himself a real beauty to live with him in the cave, and he was as pleased as anything about that. Then last
night he got the three weapons, which really are priceless treasures. Tomorrow there's going to be a Rake
Banquet to celebrate, so we're all going to benefit."
"We've been quite lucky too," the other replied, "being given these twenty ounces of silver to buy pigs and
sleep. When we get to Qianfang Market we can have a few jugs of wine to start with, and then fiddle the
accounts to make ourselves two or three ounces of silver to buy ourselves padded jackets for the winter. It's
great, isn't it?" As they laughed and talked the two monsters hurried along the main path at a great speed.
When Monkey heard about the banquet to celebrate the rake he was quietly delighted. He would have liked to
kill the devils, but it was not their fault and, besides, he had no weapon. So he flew round till he was in front
of them, turned back into himself and stood at a junction along the path. As the devils gradually came closer
he blew a mouthful of magic saliva at them, recited the words Om Humkara and made a fixing spell that held
the two wolf−headed spirits where they were. Their eyes were fixed in a stare, they could not open their
mouths, and they stood upright, both legs rigid. Monkey then knocked them over, undid their clothes and
searched them, finding the twenty ounces of silver in a purse carried by one of them in the belt of his kilt.
Each of them was also carrying a white lacquered pass. One of these read "Wily Freak" and the other read
"Freaky Wile."
Having taken their silver and undone their passes the splendid Great Sage went straight back to the city, where
he told the princes, the Tang Priest, the officials high and low and the smiths what had happened.
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1244
"I reckon my treasure's the one that shone the brightest," said Pig with a grin. "That's why they're buying pigs
and sheep for a slap−up meal to celebrate. But how are we going to get it back?"
"We'll all three of us go," said Monkey. "This silver was for buying pigs and sheep. We'll give it to the smiths:
His Royal Highness can provide us with some animals. Pig, you turn yourself into Wily Freak, I'll turn into
Freaky Wile, and Friar Sand can be a trader selling pigs and sheep. We'll go into Tigermouth Cave, and when
it suits us we'll grab our weapons, kill all the monsters, come back here to pack up and be on our way again."
"Terrific," said Friar Sand. "No time to lose. Let's go." The senior prince agreed with the plan and told his
steward to buy seven or eight pigs and four or five sheep.
The three of them left their master and gave a great display of their magic powers once outside the city.
"Brother," said Pig, "I've never seen that Wily Freak, so how can I possibly turn myself into his double?"
"I did fixing magic on him to keep him over there somewhere," Monkey said, "and he won't come round till
tomorrow. I can remember what he looks like, so you stand still while I tell you how to change. Yes, like
this...no, a bit more like that....That's it. That's him."
While the idiot said an incantation Brother Monkey blew on him with magic breath, turned him into Wily
Freak's double and gave him a white pass to tuck in at his waist. Monkey then turned himself into Freaky Wile
with a pass at his waist too, and Friar Sand made himself look like a travelling dealer in pigs and sheep. Then
they drove the pigs and sheep together along the path West towards the mountain. Before long they were in a
mountain gully, where they met another junior devil. He had the most horrible face. Just look:
A pair of round and bulging eyes
Shining like lanterns;
A head of red and bristly hair,
Blazing like fire.
A red nose,
A twisted mouth,
Sharp and pointy fangs;
Protruding ears,
A brow that seemed hacked into shape,
And a green and bloated face.
He was wearing a pale yellow tunic
And sandals made of sedge.
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1245
He looked most imposing, like some evil god,
As he hurried along like a vicious demon.
This devil was carrying a coloured lacquer invitation box under his left arm as he greeted Monkey and the
other two with a call of "Freaky Wile, good to see you both. Did you buy us some pigs and sheep?"
"Can't you see we're driving them along?" Monkey replied.
"Who's this gentleman?" the devil asked, looking at Friar Sand.
"He's the dealer in pigs and sheep," Monkey replied. "We still owe him a couple of ounces of silver, so we're
taking him home with us to fetch it. Where are you going?"
"To Bamboo Mountain to invite His Senior Majesty to the feast tomorrow morning," the devil said.
Taking his cue from the devil's tone of voice, Monkey then asked, "How many guests will there be
altogether?"
"His Senior Majesty will take the place of honour," the devil replied, "and with our own king, chiefs and the
rest of them there'll be over forty."
As they were talking Pig called, "Get a move on! The pigs and sheep are going everywhere."
"You go and invite them while I get a look at that invitation," Monkey said, and as the devil regarded him as
one of their own kind he opened the box, took out the invitation and handed it to Monkey. This is what
Monkey read when he unfolded it:
A banquet is being given tomorrow morning to celebrate the capture of the rake, and if you will condescend to
cross the mountain, honoured ancestor, Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity, I will be deeply grateful.
With a hundred kowtows,
Your grandson,
Tawny Lion
When Monkey had read it he handed it back to the devil, who returned it to its case and carried on towards the
Southeast.
"Brother," Friar Sand asked, "what did it say on the invitation?"
"It was an invitation to the Rake Banquet," Monkey replied. "It was signed, 'with a hundred kowtows, your
grandson Tawny Lion,' and the invitation was being sent to the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity.'"
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1246
"Tawny Lion must be a golden−haired lion who's become a spirit," said Friar Sand with a smile, "but I wonder
who the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity is."
Pig's reaction was to laugh and say, "He's mine."
"Why should he necessarily be yours?" Monkey asked.
"There's an old saying that goes, 'a mangy old sow can put a golden lion to flight,'" Pig replied. "That's why I
know he's mine." As they talked and laughed the three of them drove the pigs and sheep along till they could
see the gates of Tigermouth Cave. Outside the gates there were,
Green mountains all around,
Ranges forming a mighty wall.
Creepers clung to the sheer rock faces,
Thorns hung down from the towering cliffs.
Bird song came from all around the woods,
While flowers gave a welcome by the entrance.
This cave was a match for the Peach Blossom Spring,
A place to avoid the troubles of the world.
As they came closer to the mouth of the cave they saw a crowd of evil spirits of every age and kind playing
under the blossoming trees, and when they heard Pig's shouts of "Hey! Hey!" as he drove the pigs and sheep
they all came out to meet them. The pigs and sheep were caught and trussed up. The noise had by now
disturbed the demon king inside, who came out with ten or more junior demons to ask, "Are you two back?
How many animals did you buy?"
"Eight pigs and seven sheep−−fifteen altogether," Monkey replied. "The pigs cost sixteen ounces of silver and
the sheep nine. We were only given twenty ounces, so we still owe five. This is the dealer who's come with us
for the silver."
"Fetch five ounces of silver, little ones," the demon king ordered on hearing this, "and send him on his way."
"But the dealer hasn't only come to get his silver," Monkey replied. "He's come to see the banquet too."
"What nerve, Freaky Wile!" said the furious demon abusively. "You were sent off to buy things, not to talk
about banquets."
"As you've got those amazingly fine treasures, my lord," Pig said, stepping forward, "what's the harm in
letting him have a look?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1247
"Damn you too, Wily Freak," said the demon with an angry snort. "I got these treasures from inside the city of
Yuhua. If this stranger sees them and talks about them in the city the word will get around and the prince will
come to demand them. What'll we do then?"
"My lord," Monkey replied, "this dealer comes from the other side of Qianfang Market. That's a long way
from the city, and he's not a city man either, so where would he go telling tales? Besides, he's hungry, and the
two of us haven't eaten. If there's any food and liquor in the place why don't we give him some before sending
him on his way?"
Before he could finish speaking a junior devil came out with five ounces of silver that he gave to Monkey,
who in turn handed it to Friar Sand with the words, "Take your silver, stranger, then come round to the back
for something to eat with us."
Taking his courage in his hands, Friar Sand went into the cave with Pig and Monkey. When they reached the
second hall inside they saw on a table in the middle of it the nine−toothed iron rake set up in all its dazzling
brightness to receive offerings. At the Eastern end of the table was leant the gold−banded cudgel, and at the
Western end the demon−quelling staff.
"Stranger," said the demon king who was following them in, "that's the rake shining so brightly in the middle.
You're welcome to look, but don't tell anyone about it, whatever you do." Friar Sand nodded in admiration.
Oh dear! This was a case of "when the owner sees what's his he's bound to pick it up." Pig had always been a
rough customer, and once he saw his rake he was not going to talk about the facts of the case, but charged
over, pulled it down and swung it around as he turned back into himself. He struck straight at the evil spirit's
face, not caring now about the proper ways of using his weapon. Monkey and Friar Sand each rushed to one
end of the table to grab his own weapon and turn back into himself. As the three brothers started lashing out
wildly the demon king had to get out of their way in a hurry, go round to the back and fetch his four−bright
halberd with its long handle and sharp, pointed butt.
Rushing into the courtyard, he used this to hold off the three weapons and shout at the top of his voice, "Who
do you think you are, tricking me out of my treasures by impersonation?"
"I'll get you, you hairy beast," Monkey cursed back. "You don't know who I am. I'm a disciple of Tang
Sanzang, the holy monk from the East. When we came to Yuhua to present our passport the prince told his
three sons to take us as their teachers of fighting skills. They were having weapons copied from ours. That
was why ours were left in the courtyard for you to sneak into the city and steal in the middle of the night. And
you accuse us of tricking them out of you by impersonation! Stay right there and try a taste of our three
weapons."
The evil spirit at once raised his halberd to fight back. They fought from the courtyard out through the front
gate, three monks chasing a single demon. It was a splendid battle:
The cudgel whistled like the wind,
The rake's blows came raining down.
The demon−quelling staff filled the sky with glowing mist;
The four−bright halberd gave off clouds.
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1248
They were like the three immortals refining elixir,
Making dazzling light that frightened gods and ghosts.
Monkey was brilliant at displaying his might;
The evil spirit was wrong to have stolen the treasures.
Marshal Tian Peng showed off his divine powers,
While the great general Sand was heroic and splendid.
As the three brothers fought with skill and one mind
A great battle took place in Tigermouth Cave.
The ogre was full of power and cunning,
A fit match for the four heroes.
They fought until the sun set in the West,
When the demon weakened and could hold out no longer.
After their long fight on Mount Leopard Head the evil spirit shouted at Friar Sand, "Watch this halberd!" As
Friar Sand fell back to dodge the blow the evil spirit escaped through the opening he left and fled by wind to
the Xun quarter to the Southeast.
Pig started rushing after him to catch him, but Monkey said, "Let him go. As the old saying goes, 'never chase
a desperate robber.' Let's leave him nothing to come back to."
Pig agreed, and the three of them went back to the entrance of the cave, where they killed all the hundred and
more evil spirits great and small. It turned out that they were all really tigers, wolves, tiger cats, leopards, red
deer and goats. Monkey used one of his powers to bring all the valuables and fabrics, as well as the bodies of
all the animals they had killed, the pigs and the sheep out of the cave. Friar Sand used some dry wood he
found to start a fire that Pig fanned with both his ears. The cave was soon burnt out, and they took what they
had brought with them back to the city.
The city gates were wide open; people had not yet gone to bed. The senior prince and his sons were still
waiting in the Gauze Pavilion. The three disciples dropped all the dead wild animals and sheep as well as the
valuables with loud thumps into the courtyard, filling it up as they called out, "Master, we're back. We've
won."
The senior prince then expressed his thanks to them, the Tang priest was delighted, and the three young
princes fell to their knees to bow.
"Don't thank us," Friar Sand said, helping them to their feet. "Come and see what we've got."
"Where are they from?" the senior prince asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1249
"The tigers, wolves, tiger cats, leopards, red deer and goats were all monsters that made themselves into
spirits. When we'd got our weapons back we fought our way out through the gates. Their demon king is a
golden−haired lion who fights with a four−bright halberd. He battled it out with us till nightfall, then ran away
to the Southeast. Instead of chasing him we made sure he'd have nowhere to come back to by killing all these
devils and bringing back all his things."
This news both delighted and alarmed the senior prince: he was delighted at their triumphant return; worried
that the demon would seek his revenge later.
"Don't worry, Your Royal Highness," said Monkey. "I've thought about it very carefully, and I'll deal with it
properly. I promise to exterminate the demons completely before we go. We'll definitely not leave you with
trouble that'll come back later. When we went there at noon we ran into a little green−faced, red−haired devil
who was carrying an invitation. What it said on it was: 'A banquet is being given tomorrow morning to
celebrate the capture of the rake, and if you will condescend to cross the mountain, honoured ancestor, Primal
Sage of Ninefold Numinosity, I will be deeply grateful.' It was signed: 'with a hundred kowtows, your
grandson, Tawny Lion'. When the evil spirit was defeated just now he must have gone to have a word with his
grandfather. They're bound to come looking for us to get their revenge tomorrow morning, and when that
happens I'll wipe them all out for you." The senior prince thanked him and had supper arranged. When master
and disciples had eaten, everybody went to bed.
The story now tells of how the evil spirit really did head Southeast to Bamboo Mountain, in which there was a
cave called the Nine−bend Twisty Cave where the evil spirit's grandfather, the Primal Sage of Ninefold
Numinosity, lived. That night the demon did not stop treading the wind until he reached the cave's entrance in
the last watch.
When he knocked on the gates and went in a junior devil greeted him with the words, "Your Majesty,
Greenface brought the invitation last night, and the old gentleman invited him to say till this morning to go to
your Rake Banquet with him. Why have you come here so very early to invite him yourself?"
"I hate to have to say it," the evil spirit replied, "but the banquet is off."
As they were talking Greenface came out from the inner part of the cave to say, "What are you doing here,
Your Majesty? As soon as His Senior Majesty's up he's coming to the celebration with me." The evil spirit
was so distraught that he could say nothing, but only wave his hands.
A little later the old demon got up and called for the evil spirit, who dropped his weapon and prostrated
himself on the ground to kowtow, tears streaming down his cheeks. "Worthy grandson," the old demon said,
"you sent me an invitation yesterday, and this morning I'm on my way to the celebration. So why have you
come yourself, looking so miserable and upset?"
"I was taking a stroll in the moonlight the night before last," the evil spirit replied, still kowtowing, "when I
saw a dazzling light rising up to the sky from the city of Yuhua. I hurried there to take a look and saw that it
came from three weapons in the prince's palace: a nine−toothed rake with gold in it, a staff and a gold−banded
cudgel. I used my magic to take them away and decided to have a Rake Banquet to celebrate. I sent some of
my underlings to buy pigs, sheep and fruit for the feast that I invited you to come and enjoy, Grandfather. But
after I sent Greenface over with the invitation yesterday Wily Freak and the other one who'd been told to buy
pigs and sheep came back with a dealer, a stranger, for some silver. The stranger was all set on seeing the
banquet. I refused as I was afraid he'd spread the news around. Then they said they were hungry and asked for
some food to eat, so I told them to go round the back to eat. When they got inside and saw the weapons they
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1250
said they were theirs. They each snatched one and turned back into their real selves. One was a monk with a
hairy face and a mouth like a thunder god's, one was a monk with a long snout and big ears, and one was a
monk with a really sinister face. The three of them yelled at me and started lashing out: they didn't care at all.
I just managed to fetch my four−bright halberd and come out to hold them at bay. When I asked them who
they were and how they dared go in for impersonation they told me they were disciples of the Tang Priest
who's been sent to the Western Heaven by Great Tang in the East. When they went to present their passport
on their way through the city the princes pressed them to stay and teach them martial arts. They said their
three weapons had been left in the palace yard for copies of them to be made, and that I'd stolen them. Then
they went for me with great fury. I didn't know what those three monks are called, but they're all very good
fighters. As I was no match for them by myself I had to run away and come here. If you have any love for
your grandson I beg you to lend me your arms in order to get my revenge on those monks."
After a moment's silent thought the old demon replied with a smile, "So it's them. Worthy grandson, you made
a big mistake provoking him."
"Do you know who they are, grandfather?" the other asked.
"The one with a long snout and big ears is Zhu Bajie," the old demon said, "and the one with a horrible face is
Friar Sand. They're not too bad. But the one with a hairy face and a mouth like a thunder god is called Sun the
Novice. He's got really tremendous magical powers. When he made great havoc in Heaven five hundred years
ago a hundred thousand heavenly troops couldn't catch him. And he's a most determined hunter. He's like a
policeman who'll search mountains and seas, smash caves, storm cities and cause all sorts of trouble. Why did
you have to provoke him? Never mind. I'll go with you and capture those so−and−sos and the prince of Yuhua
to avenge you."
On hearing this the evil spirit kowtowed again in thanks. The senior demon immediately mustered his
grandsons Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion, Leo, Gryphon, Raccoon−dog Lion and Elephant−fighter, each of
whom carried a sharp weapon. With Tawny Lion leading the way each of them set off a powerful gale that
carried them straight to Mount Leopard Head, where there was an all−pervasive smell of smoke and fire and
all that could be heard was sobbing. When they looked more closely they saw Wily Freak and Freaky Wile
weeping for their lord.
"Are you the real Freak and Wile or impostors?" the evil spirit shouted as he went up to them.
Falling to their knees and kowtowing with tears in their eyes, the two devils replied, "We're no impostors.
After we were given the silver to buy pigs and sheep yesterday we met a monk with a hairy face and a mouth
like a thunder god in the wide valley to the West of the mountain. When he spat on us our legs went all weak,
our mouths went stiff, we couldn't speak and we couldn't move. He knocked us over, found and stole our
silver and took our passes off us. We were left in a daze till we came round just now. When we got home we
found the place still on fire and all the buildings burnt down. We were crying so bitterly because you, my lord,
and all the chiefs had disappeared. We don't know how the fire was started."
When the evil spirit heard this he could not stop his tears from gushing forth as he stamped his feet in fury, let
loose heaven−shaking roars and exclaimed in hatred and fury, "Damned baldies! Vicious beasts! How could
you be so evil? You've destroyed my cave palace and burnt my beauty to death. You've killed everyone,
young and old, in the household. I'm so angry I could die!"
The old demon then told Monkey Lion to take hold of Tawny Lion, saying, "Grandson, what's done is done.
Upsetting yourself won't do you any good. What you must do now is summon up all your energy to catch
those monks in the city."
Journey to the West
Chapter 89 1251
The evil spirit was still crying as he replied, "Grandfather, this mountain palace of mine wasn't built in a day.
Now those damned baldies have destroyed everything! My life's not worth living!" With that he broke free
and flung himself forward to smash his head against the rock−face, only stopping after Snowy Lion and
Monkey Lion had made great efforts to calm him. They then left the cave and all headed for the city.
With a roaring wind and in a thick fog they approached the city, so frightening all the people living outside
the city wall that they abandoned their belongings and dragged or carried their children with them as they fled
into the city. Once the people were all inside the gates were shut. A report was then made to the palace that a
disaster was upon them. When the prince, who was taking a vegetarian breakfast in the Gauze Pavilion with
the Tang Priest and the others, heard this report he went out to ask about it:
"A whole crowd of evil spirits are heading for the city with sandstorms, flying stones, fogs and wind."
"Whatever shall we do?" asked the prince, deeply alarmed.
"All stop worrying," said Brother Monkey, "all stop worrying. It's the evil spirit from Tigermouth Cave who
ran away when he was beaten yesterday. He went to the Southeast to gang up with the Primal Sage of
Ninefold Numinosity or whatever he's called and now he's here. We brothers are going out. Tell them to shut
all the city gates, and send men to hold the city wall." The prince ordered that the city gates be shut, sent men
to the wall, and went with his sons and the Tang Priest to inspect. The army's banners blotted out the sun, and
the cannon fire reached the sky as Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand left the city amid wind and clouds to give
battle. Indeed:
Because they were careless the weapons were lost,
Which led to attacks by the devilish host.
If you do not know the outcome of the battle listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 90
By Giving and Receiving the Master and the Lion Turn into One
After Stealing the Way and Obstructing Dhyana Ninefold Numinosity Is Pacified
The story tells how the Great Sage Sun left the city with Pig and Friar Sand and looked the monsters in the
face to see that they were all lions of various kinds. The Tawny Lion Spirit was leading, with Leo and
Elephant−fighter Lion on his left, Gryphon and Raccoon−dog Lion on his right and Monkey Lion with Snowy
Lion behind him. In the middle of them all was a nine−headed lion. The ogre Greenface was holding a canopy
of brocade embroidered with flowers just behind the nine−headed lion; while Wily Freak and Freaky Wile
carried a pair of red flags. They were all drawn up at a hollow place.
In his rough way Pig went up to them to shout abusively, "Ogres! Thieves! Treasure−stealers! What did you
go there and gang up with that hairy lot for?"
To this the Tawny Lion Spirit retorted, gnashing his teeth in fury, "Vicious baldies! When I was alone
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1252
yesterday the three of you beat me and I had to run away. You should have done right, instead of burning my
cave palace, destroying my mountain home and murdering my family. My hatred for you is as great as the
ocean. Stay where you are and take this from my halberd!"
The splendid Pig raised his rake to parry the blow. When the two of them had just started fighting and neither
was yet coming out on top Monkey Lion joined in, swinging his spiked iron club, as did Snowy Lion with his
three−edged mace.
"Welcome," shouted Pig. Watch him as he charges straight forward to meet their onslaught and fight with
them all. Friar Sand quickly pulled his demon−quelling staff out from where he was at the side and hurried
forward to help Pig, at which Leo Spirit, Gryphon Spirit, Elephant−fighter Spirit and Raccoon−dog Spirit all
piled in. The Great Sage Monkey held the evil spirits at bay with his gold−banded cudgel. Leo fought with a
club, Snowy with a bronze hammer, Elephant−fighter with a steel spear and Raccoon−dog with a battleaxe.
The fight between the seven lion spirits and the three ferocious monks was a splendid one:
Club, hammer, spear, axe and three−edged mace,
Spiked club, ball−staff and four−bright halberd:
Seven lions with seven deadly weapons,
Shouting their war cries as they surround three monks.
Powerful was the Great Sage's gold−banded cudgel;
Friar Sand's staff was almost matchless in the world.
Pig moved around with the power of a whirlwind
As his flashing rake gave off baleful light.
All, displaying their might, blocked before and behind,
Held off the onslaughts with daring and courage.
From the walls of the city the prince lent support,
Where his soldiers felt braver as they beat drums and gongs.
Throwing and thrusting, all showed off their magic,
Turning heaven and earth both dark and upside−down.
After the evil spirits had been fighting the Great Sage and the two others for half a day, night fell. Pig by now
was dribbling and his legs were going weak, so he feinted with his rake and fled in defeat.
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1253
"Where do you think you're going?" Snowy Lion and Monkey Lion shouted. "Take this!"
The idiot could not dodge them, and he took a heavy blow from the mace on his spine that laid him flat on the
ground crying out, "I'm done for, I'm done for!"
The two lion spirits grabbed Pig by the bristles on his neck and by his tail and carried him over to see the
nine−headed lion, "Grandfather," they reported, "we've caught one of them."
Before the words were out of their mouths Friar Sand and Monkey also had to fall back, beaten. When the evil
spirits all came after them Monkey pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them to pieces, spat them out,
shouted, "Change!" and turned them into more than one hundred little Monkeys who went round and round,
surrounding Snowy, Leo, Elephant−fighter, Raccoon−dog and Tawny Lion. Friar Sand and Monkey then
came forward to join in the fight again. Later that night they caught Leo and Gryphon and put Raccoon−dog
and Elephant−fighter to flight.
When Tawny Lion reported to the old demon that two of the lions had been lost the demon ordered, "Tie Pig
up but don't kill him. When they give our lions back we'll return Pig to them. If they're stupid enough to kill
them we'll make Pig pay with his life." That evening all the fiends slept outside the city.
The story now turns to the Great Sage Sun, who carried the two lion spirits to beside the city wall, from where
the senior prince saw him and ordered that the gates be opened. Twenty or thirty officers were sent out with
rope to tie the lion spirits up and carry them into the city. The Great Sage then put his magic hairs away and
went straight with Friar Sand to the wall tower, where he saw the Tang Priest.
"This is a terrible business," the Tang Priest said. "Is Wuneng still alive?"
"No problem," Brother Monkey replied. "As we've captured a couple of the evil spirits they won't possibly
dare harm him. Have them tied up tight. I'll swap them for Pig tomorrow morning."
The three young princes then kowtowed to Monkey and said, "When you were fighting them at first you were
by yourself, Teacher. Then when you pretended to run away and came back again there were over a hundred
of you. How was that done? When you came back to the city wall after capturing the evil spirits there was
only one of you again. What magical powers did you use to do that?"
"I have 84,000 hairs on my body," Monkey replied. "Each of them can become ten, and the ten become a
hundred, so I can do millions and millions of transformations. It's extra body magic." The princes all
kowtowed as a vegetarian feast was brought to the tower for them. All along the battlements lanterns and
banners were displayed. There was the sound of clappers, bells, gongs and drums as the watches were
changed, arrows passed on, cannons fired and warcries shouted.
Soon it was dawn, and the old demon sent for Tawny Lion Spirit to make a plan of action: "You must all use
your wits to capture Sun the Novice and Friar Sand while I make a secret flight up onto the wall to capture
their master, the old prince and his sons. I'll take them back to the Nine−bend Twisty Cave and wait for you to
come back in triumph."
Accepting this plan, Tawny Lion took Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion, Elephant−fighter and Raccoon−dog back
to beside the city wall, all carrying their weapons and demanding battle amid winds and fog.
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1254
On the other side Monkey and Friar Sand jumped on the wall, where Monkey yelled abusively at the top of
his voice, "Thieving damned ogres! Give me my brother Pig back this moment and I'll spare your lives. If you
don't I'll smash your bones to powder and chop you all into little pieces." With no further argument the evil
spirits all charged into the attack. The Great Sage and Friar Sand had to use skill and cunning to hold the five
lions at bay. This fight was very different from the one on the previous day.
As an evil wind howled across the land
Black fog blotted out the sky.
Moving stones and flying sands alarmed both gods and demons;
As the trees in the forest fell the tigers and wolves were afraid.
Fierce was the spear of steel and bright the axe,
Merciless the rod, the halberd and the brazen hammer.
They wished they could swallow Monkey up whole,
And capture Friar Sand live and kicking.
The Great Sage's As−You−Will cudgel
Could attack and defend with miraculous effect.
Friar Sand's demon−quelling staff
Had won its fame outside the Hall of Miraculous Mist.
Now that it moved with its magical powers,
It would achieve glory in the West by wiping out demons.
While the five lion spirits with coats of different colours were fighting really well with Monkey and Friar
Sand the old demon flew on a black cloud straight to the wall tower, where he shook his heads, which gave
the military and civil officials, Sanzang, the senior prince and the soldiers guarding the wall such a fright that
they all fell off. The demon then charged into the tower, opened his mouths, took Sanzang, the senior prince
and his sons in them one by one, and went back to the hollow ground, where he took Pig in another mouth,
one of the nine he had in his nine heads. One mouth held the Tang Priest, one Pig, one the senior prince, one
his eldest son, one the second son and one the third son.
With six mouths full of six people he still had three mouths empty and wide open as he roared, "I'm going
back ahead." The five junior lion spirits all fought more bravely than ever now that they had seen their
grandfather's triumph.
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1255
As soon as Monkey heard the yells from the wall and realized he had fallen for a trick, he gave Friar Sand a
quick shout to be careful then pulled all the hairs off his arms, put them in his mouth, chewed them up and
spat them out as well over a thousand little Monkeys who swarmed into the attack. They knocked Monkey
Lion over, took Snowy alive, captured Elephant−fighter, laid Raccoon−dog Lion low and killed Tawny Lion;
but as they returned to the city wall with a great hubbub they let Greenface, Wily Freak and Freaky Wile
escape. When the officers on the wall saw what had happened they opened the gates, tied up the five lion
spirits with ropes and carried them into the city.
But before they could deal with them the princess appeared, sobbing and weeping, to say, "Holy teachers, His
Royal Highness the prince, our sons and your master are all dead. How ever is this isolated city to survive?"
Putting his magic hairs away, Monkey bowed to her and said, "Don't upset yourself, Princess. It was only
because I'd captured seven of his lion spirits that the old demon carried off my master, His Royal Highness
and your sons with catching magic. I'm certain they'll come to no harm. My brother−disciple and I will go to
his mountain first thing tomorrow morning, and I can guarantee that we'll catch the old demon and bring your
four princes back to you."
When the princess and her womenfolk heard this they all bowed to Monkey and said, "We pray that His Royal
Highness and his sons will all be safe and that our dynasty will be secure." When their bowing was done the
womenfolk all returned to the palace in tears.
"Skin the Tawny Lion spirit we killed," Brother Monkey instructed the officials, "and have the five who are
still alive securely tied up and put under lock and key. Bring us some vegetarian food to eat before we go to
sleep. Stop worrying: I promise nothing will go wrong."
The next morning the Great Sage took Friar Sand up on an auspicious cloud. Before long they were at the top
of Bamboo Mountain, and as they brought their cloud down to look they saw that it was magnificent:
Rows of jutting peaks,
Sheer and craggy ridges.
In the deep gill waters gently flow;
Flowers weave a fragrant brocade before the beetling cliff,
Where the ridges twist and double back,
Encircled by the ancient winding paths.
When the crane comes the pine has a companion,
And the rock is left alone as the cloud drifts away.
The black ape heads for brightness when looking for fruit;
The deer rejoice in the warming sun as they search for flowers.
The green phoenix sings sweetly
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1256
And the golden bird's melodies never stop.
In spring the peach blossom contends with the plum;
In summer the willow and locust trees are rivals.
In autumn are carpets of chrysanthemums,
And in winter the snow flies all around.
Here there is beauty throughout the year,
Where the scenery can compare with Yingzhou's magic land.
As the two of them were standing on the mountain admiring the view Greenface suddenly appeared in a
ravine between cliffs. He was holding a short cudgel. "Where do you think you're going?" Monkey shouted.
"I'm here."
This gave the young devil such a fright that he went running and tumbling down the ravine. Monkey and Friar
Sand went straight after him but could find no sign of where he had gone. When they went further and
searched around they found a cave palace with double gates of mottled stone that were firmly closed. Above
the gates a stone tablet was set on which was written in large block letters:
NINE−BEND TWISTY CAVE,
MIGHTY BAMBOO MOUNTAIN
Now when the junior devil ran inside the cave he had shut the gates firmly behind him. Once inside he
reported to the old demon, "My lord, those two monks are outside."
"Have your lord, Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion, Elephant−fighter and Raccoon−dog come back yet?" the old
demon asked.
"I haven't seen them," the junior demon replied.
"There were just the two monks looking around from high up on the peak. As soon as I saw them I turned and
ran. As they came after me I shut the gates."
The old demon bowed his head in silence at this news. After a while his tears began to flow as he called out,
"This is terrible. My grandson Tawny Lion is dead. My grandsons Monkey Lion and the rest of them have all
been captured by those monks and taken into the city. How am I to get my revenge?"
Pig was tied up nearby, crammed in together with the Tang Priest and the princes, terrified and miserable until
he heard the old demon saying that his grandsons had been captured and taken into the city. At this he said
with quiet delight, "Don't be afraid, Master. Cheer up, Your Royal Highness. My elder brother has won. He's
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1257
captured the whole lot of the devils and he's found his way here to rescue us."
When he had said this the old demon could be heard shouting, "Little ones, guard the place well while I go out
to catch those other two monks. Then we can punish them all together."
Watch him as he strides off without armor or weapons. When he heard Monkey shouting he threw the gates of
the cave wide open and went straight for him, not deigning to answer. Monkey raised his iron cudgel to stop
him with a blow to the head while Friar Sand swung his staff at him. As the demon shook his principal head
the eight other heads to left and right of it all opened their mouths, with which they gently picked Monkey and
Friar Sand up and carried them into the cave.
"Fetch rope," he ordered; and Wily Freak, Freaky Wile and Greenface, who had come back after their escape
the previous night, brought two ropes with which they tied the two of them up very securely. "Impudent ape,"
said the old demon, "you captured my seven grandsons. But now I've caught you four monks and the four
princes I've got enough to ransom them with. Little ones, get some thorns and willow rods and beat this ape
for me to avenge my grandson Tawny Lion."
The three junior devils then beat Monkey with willow rods, but Monkey's body had been so toughened that all
the rods could do was to scratch his itches. He made no sound and was not in the least bothered, no matter
how hard they hit him. The sight of it, however, made Pig, the Tang Priest and the princes all feel their hair
standing on end. Before long the rods started to break up, but the demons kept on till evening, keeping no
count of the number of strokes.
Friar Sand was most upset to see Monkey being given so long a flogging, so he said, "Let me take a hundred
or so for him."
"Don't be so impatient," the old demon replied, "you'll get your beating tomorrow. You'll all be done in turn."
"That means it'll be me the day after tomorrow," said Pig with alarm. The beating continued for a while as
night slowly fell.
"Little ones," the old demon called, "stop for now. Light the lamp and go for something to eat and drink. I'm
off to my Brocade Cloud Den for a little shut−eye. You three have all had a hard time, so keep a close watch
on them. We'll carry on with the beatings tomorrow." The three junior devils moved a lamp over and hit
Monkey some more on the top of his head with their willow rods, tic−tic−toc, toc−toc−tic, like the rhythm of
a wooden clapper, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. By then it was very late and they all fell asleep.
Monkey now used escaping magic to shrink himself, wriggled out of his bonds, shook his fur, straightened up
his clothes, took the cudgel out of his ear and shook it till it was as thick as a well−bucket and about twenty
feet long.
Then he said to the three junior devils, "You animals, you hit me an awful lot of times, and now I'm going to
return the compliment. I'll just shove this at you and see how you like it." One gentle push from the cudgels
turned the three devils into three lumps of minced pork. Monkey then turned up the lamp and released Friar
Sand.
Pig, who was feeling desperate about being tied up, could not stop himself from yelling at the top of his voice,
"My hands and feet are tied up so tight they're swollen. Why don't you come and free me?"
The idiot's shout at once woke up the old demon, who rolled straight out of bed and called out, "Who's setting
them free?" The moment Monkey heard this he blew out the lamp, smashed his way through several sets of
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1258
doors with his cudgel and fled, not bothering about Friar Sand and the rest of them, while the old demon went
into the main hall shouting, "Little ones, why's there no light? Don't let them get away!" He shouted once
without getting an answer, then again, and still no answer.
When he fetched a lantern and looked all he could see were three gory lumps of minced meat on the floor. The
prince, his sons, the Tang Priest and Pig were still there, but Monkey and Friar Sand had disappeared. He lit a
torch, searched the front and the back and could find only Friar Sand, who was still standing pressed against
the wall of a corridor. The demon knocked him down, tied him up as before, and carried on looking for
Monkey. Seeing that pair after pair of his doors had been smashed down, he realized that Monkey had
destroyed them in his flight. Instead of giving chase he patched up and blockaded the doors and guarded his
home.
The story now tells how Monkey left the Nine−bend Twisty Cave and rode by auspicious cloud straight back
to the city of Yuhua, where all the local deities and spirits as well as the god of the city could be seen bowing
in mid−air to greet him.
"Why have you only come to see me today?" Monkey asked. "When we knew that the worthy prince was
entertaining you in Yuhua, Great Sage," they replied, "we did not venture to greet you. But now that the
princes have been captured by ogres and you have subdued those monsters we have come to welcome you
with kowtows." While Monkey was abusing them the Gold−headed Protector and the Six Ding and Six Jia
generals escorted a local deity in and made him kneel on the ground.
"Great Sage," they said, "we've arrested this ground devil."
"What are you making a noise here for instead of guarding my master on Bamboo Mountain?" Monkey
yelled.
"Great Sage," the Ding and Jia gods replied, "the evil spirit caught the Curtain−raising General and tied him
up again after you escaped. As we could see how great his magic powers are we've brought the local deity of
Bamboo Mountain here. He knows all about that evil spirit's background, so we beg you to question him,
Great Sage, and find out how best to deal with him and deliver the holy monks and worthy princes from their
suffering." When Monkey heard this he was delighted.
"The old demon came down to Bamboo Mountain the year before last," the local deity said, shivering and
shaking as he kowtowed. "The Nine−bend Twisty Cave used to be the den of six lions. Once the old demon
came the six lions all took him as their grandfather. He is a nine−headed lion called the Primal Sage of
Ninefold Numinosity. If you want to deal with him you must go to the Wonderful Crag Palace in the
uttermost East and fetch his master here to subdue him. Nobody else can possibly do it."
When Monkey heard this he thought for a long time before saying, "The Wonderful Crag Palace in the
uttermost East is where the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad lives. Yes, he does have just such
a nine−headed lion under his throne. Protector, Jias," he ordered, "go back with the local deity and keep a
secret watch on the master, my brother disciple, the prince of the city and his sons. The city god must guard
the wall and moat. Off you go." The gods all took up guard as instructed.
The Great Sage set off his somersault cloud and traveled through the night till it was about the last watch,
when he reached the Eastern Gate of Heaven, where he ran into the Heavenly King Virupaksa with his retinue
of heavenly soldiers and warriors, who stopped, put their hands together in greeting and asked, "Where are
you going, Great Sage?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1259
"I'm off to the Wonderful Crag Palace," Monkey replied when he had returned their greetings. "Why have you
come to the Eastern Heaven instead of following your road to the Western Heaven?" Virupaksa asked. "When
we reached the city of Yuhua," Monkey replied, "the prince of the city entertained us and told his three sons to
take us as their teachers of martial arts. We had a most unpleasant surprise: coming up against a gang of lion
monsters. Now I'm going to ask the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad, the chief monster's
owner, to subdue him and save my master."
"It was because you wanted to be a teacher that you provoked that trouble with the lions," said the heavenly
king. "How true," replied Monkey with a smile, "how true." The heavenly soldiers and warriors all raised
joined hands in greeting then stood aside to let him pass. Monkey went in through the Eastern Gate of Heaven
and was soon at the Wonderful Crag Palace. This is what could be seen:
Coloured clouds behind coloured clouds,
Purple mists and rich, green vegetation.
The roof−tiles are a surge of golden flame,
And at the gates are imposing beasts of jade.
Flowers grow between gate towers, round which red mists drift;
The sun shines on turquoise vapors rising from the woods.
All the immortals pay their respects,
And a thousand sages make everything flourish.
The halls of the palace are like layers of brocade;
Windows and pavilions open on all sides.
Azure dragons glow with sacred clouds;
Golden beams of brilliant light come from the magic mists.
This is a land of splendor and eternal joy,
The Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East.
There was an immortal boy wearing a rainbow mantle standing at the palace gates, and as soon as he noticed
the Great Sage he went in to report, "My lord, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven is
here." When the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad heard this he ordered all the immortals in
attendance on him to go out to welcome Monkey and bring him into the palace. Here the Heavenly Honoured
One was sitting on a nine−coloured lotus throne amid countless rays of auspicious light, and when he saw
Monkey he came down from his throne to greet him while Monkey bowed to him from below.

"Great Sage," the Heavenly Honoured One said, returning his bow, "I haven't seen you for years, but I did
hear that you have abandoned the Way for Buddhism and are escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures
from the Western Heaven. I presume that you have now succeeded."
"Not yet," Monkey replied, "but near enough. I have escorted the Tang Priest as far as Yuhua, where the
prince told his three sons to take me and the other two as their teachers of martial arts and had copies of our
three magic weapons made. The weapons were, to our surprise, stolen one night. When I searched for them
the next day I found that they had been stolen by a spirit turned by a golden−haired lion from Tigermouth
Cave on Mount Leopard Head. I tricked them back from him by cunning, whereupon the spirit ganged up with
some other lion spirits to give me a tremendous fight. One of them is a nine−headed lion with enormous
magic powers who carried my master, Pig, the prince and his three sons to the Ninebend Twisty Cave on
Mount Bamboo. When Friar Sand and I went to look for them the next day we were carried off too. He had
me tied up and hit so often I lost count. Luckily I was able to make my get−away by magic, but they're still
suffering there. When I questioned the local deity I found out that you were his master, Heavenly Honoured
One, which is why I'm here to ask you to subdue the lion and rescue them."
As soon as the Heavenly Honoured One heard this he sent his immortal officers to the lion house to call out
his lionkeeper slave and question him. The lionkeeper slave was sleeping so deeply that the officers had to
push and shake him before they could wake him up and drag him into the main hall. Here the Heavenly
Honoured One asked him, "Where is the lion?"
All the slave could do was to kowtow with tears streaming down his face, pleading, "Spare me, spare me."
"The Great Sage Sun is here," the Heavenly Honoured One replied, "so I won't have you beaten just yet. You
must explain this instant your carelessness in letting the nine−headed lion escape."
"My lord," the lionkeeper replied, "I stole and drank a jug of wine I saw in the Sweet Dew Palace of the Great
Chiliocosm. Before I realized what had happened I was dead drunk. It must have slipped its chains and got
away."
"That wine was given me by Lord Lao Zi of the Supreme Ultimate," the Heavenly Honoured One replied. "It's
called Cyclical Nectar, and after drinking that you would have slept for three days. How many days has the
lion been gone?"
"What the local deity said was that he went down there the year before last, which would mean two years or
more," the Great Sage said.
"That's right," the Heavenly Honoured One said with a smile, "A day in the palaces of Heaven is a year in the
mortal world. Get up," he said to the lion−tamer. "I'll spare your life. Come down to the lower world with the
Great Sage and me to recapture him. You immortals can all go back. None of you need come with us."
The Heavenly Honoured One, the lion−keeper slave and the Great Sage all went by cloud straight to Bamboo
Mountain, where the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Six Dings, the Six Jias and the local
deity of the mountain all knelt to greet them.
"Has my master been harmed while you people have been protecting him?" Brother Monkey asked.
"The evil spirit was so angry that he went to sleep," the gods replied. "He didn't torture them any more."
"That Primal Sage of mine is a true soul who has long cultivated the Way," the Heavenly Honoured One
remarked. "A single call from him will go up to the Three Sages and down to the Underworld. He wouldn't
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1261
kill anyone lightly. Great Sage Sun, go to his gates, challenge him to battle and draw him outside for us to
catch."
As soon as Monkey heard this he sprang towards the mouth of the cave, brandishing his cudgel and shouting
loudly and abusively, "Damned evil spirit, give me my people back! Damned evil spirit, give me my people
back!" He shouted several times, but the old demon was fast asleep and nobody answered. Monkey lost his
patience, swung his cudgel and smashed his way inside, still cursing.
Only then did the old demon wake up, rise to his feet and yell with great fury, "I'm coming for you!" He shook
his heads and opened his jaws to pick Monkey up.
As Monkey turned and fled the evil spirit chased after him till they were outside the cave, shouting, "Where
do you think you're going, you thieving ape?"
"How dare you go on behaving so dreadfully!" said Monkey with a grin from where he was standing on the
top of a high cliff. "You haven't even got the sense to realize that your life's at stake. Don't you see your
master's here?"
By the time the evil spirit reached the cliff in pursuit of Monkey the Heavenly Honoured One had said a spell
and shouted, "I'm here, my little Primal Sage." Recognizing his master, the monster gave up the struggle and
lay down with all four feet on the ground, kowtowing.
The lionkeeper then ran over to him, took hold of his mane, and punched him hundreds of times on the neck,
saying abusively, "Why did you run away, animal? You got me into terrible trouble." The lion kept his
mouths shut and said nothing, not daring to move, and the lionkeeper only stopped hitting him when his fist
was tired out. When a brocade saddlecloth had been put on the animal's back the Heavenly Honoured One
mounted and shouted to it to go. They then rose up on coloured clouds and went straight back to the
Wonderful Crag Palace.
After addressing his thanks skywards the Great Sage went into the cave and freed first the prince of Yuhua,
then Sanzang, then Pig, Friar Sand and the three young princes. After this they made a leisurely search of the
cave and led everyone outside. Pig then fetched some dry brushwood, piled it at the front and the back, and
started a fire that left the Nine−bend Twisty Cave looking like a ruined, burnt−out kiln. Monkey released all
the gods, ordered the local deity to keep guard on it, and told Pig and Friar Sand to use their magic to carry the
four princes back to the city while he helped the Tang Priest along. They were soon back at the city, where the
princess and the officials all came out to greet them. It was now getting dark, and a vegetarian feast was
provided for everyone to enjoy. The venerable elder and his disciples slept in the Gauze Pavilion once more,
and the princes in the living quarters of the palace. Of that night no more need be said.
The next day the prince issued an order for another great vegetarian banquet to be laid on. Each of the
officials high and low in the palace expressed his gratitude, and Monkey asked for butchers to slaughter the
six lions who were still alive, skin them like the tawny lion, and prepare their meat to be eaten. The prince,
who was delighted with this proposal, gave the order for them to be killed. One animal was kept for the inside
and outside palace staff, one was given to the chief administrator and the other officials in the palace, and the
flesh of the other five was cut into lumps weighing one or two ounces that officers distributed among the
soldiers and civilians inside and outside the city wall so that they could all eat a little. Thus the people could
both try the taste and overcome their fear. Every single household was most impressed.
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1262
By now the smiths had made the three weapons and were kowtowing to Monkey, saying, "My lord, we have
finished our work."
"How heavy are they?" Monkey asked.
"The gold−banded cudgel weighs a thousand pounds," the smiths replied, "and the nine−toothed rake and the
demon−quelling staff each eight hundred pounds."
"That'll do," said Monkey, who then had the three princes asked to come out. As each took his weapon they
said to the senior prince, "Your Royal Highness, our weapons have now been finished."
"They almost cost both your father and yourselves their lives," the senior prince replied. "Thanks to our divine
teachers' powers," the young princes said, "we were all saved and the evil spirits have been wiped out. We'll
have no trouble from them in future. Now this really is a world at peace with calm seas and rivers running
clear." The four princes then rewarded the smiths and went to the Gauze Pavilion to thank the teachers.
Sanzang told the Great Sage and the other two to pass on some more martial skills quickly so as not to delay
their journey. The three of them all swung their weapons in the palace yard as they taught the secrets one by
one. Within a few days the three young princes were all skilled performers. They also mastered all the
seventy−two routines of attack, retreat and fast and slow fighting. This was firstly because the princes were all
thoroughly determined, and secondly because the Great Sage Sun had given them the divine strength
beforehand that enabled them to lift and move the thousand−pound cudgel and the eight−hundred−pound rake
and staff. There was all the difference in the world between their present skills and those they had had before,
and there is a poem that goes:
When they celebrated their fortune in finding divine teachers
They never expected their studies to alert a lion spirit.
With evil destroyed the country was at peace;
The frontier was settled as all were devoted to the one
Entity. Ninefold Numinosity's powers lasted through their many clashes
Till the Way was achieved with all−round expertise.
The brilliant teaching would be passed on for ever,
And Yuhua know eternal peace and joy.
The prince then gave another great banquet to thank the three teachers, and a huge dish of gold and silver was
brought out as a reward. "Take it straight back inside," Monkey said with a smile, "take it straight back. We're
monks, and that's no use to us."
"We really can't take gold or silver," put in Pig who was standing beside him, "but the lion spirits tore our
clothes to ribbons. If you could give us a change of clothing that would be very kind of you." The prince
Journey to the West
Chapter 90 1263
ordered his tailors to fetch some bolts of blue, red and brown brocade and make each of them a garment after
the style and colours of their old ones. The three of them were delighted to accept and put on their new
brocade tunics, after which they packed up the luggage and set off on their way again. Everyone inside and
outside the city, whether young or old, exclaimed that they were arhats and living Buddhas come down to
earth. Crowds packed the streets to the sound of drums and music, and banners flew overhead. Indeed:
From the gate of every family the incense smoke arose;
At every household's door coloured lanterns hung in rows.
The people only went back after seeing them for a long way along their journey. Only then did the four
travelers manage to leave the city and head West. By leaving they shook off all thought and immersed their
hearts in the True Achievement. Indeed:
Free from thought and worry, the Buddha's land they seek,
Going faithfully, sincerely, towards the Vulture Peak.
If you do not know how much further the journey was to be or when it was to end, listen to the explanation in
the next installment.

Admiring the Moon Festival Lanterns in Jinping
The Tang Priest Confesses in Dark Essence Cave
Where should one strive to practice dhyana?
Swiftly to extirpate the misdeeds of the thought−horse and the mind−ape.
When they are firmly tethered they give off radiance,
But whoever halts falls to the three paths of suffering.
If one allows the divine elixir to leak away,
The jade−pure nature will wither as one slackens.
Anger, joy and worry must all be swept away:
When the wonderful mystery is gained it seems like nothing.
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1264
The story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples left the city of Yuhua and had a very easy journey
in what really was a land of paradise. When they had been travelling for five or six days another city
appeared.
"Where is this?" the Tang Priest asked Brother Monkey.
"It's a city," Monkey replied, "but there are no flags on the poles above the city wall and I don't know this
area, so I'll ask when we get closer." When they reached the Eastern suburb they found it noisy with bars and
tea−houses and bustling with a rice market and oil shops. Some idlers who were wandering in the streets with
nothing better to do crowded round for a better look when they saw Pig's long snout, Friar Sand's black face
and Monkey's red eyes, but they dared not come any closer to question the travelers. The Tang Priest was
sweating with the worry that they would provoke trouble as they crossed several more streets and had still not
yet reached the city wall. Then they saw a monastery gate over which were the words CLOUDS OF
COMPASSION MONASTERY.
"What about going in here to give the horse a rest and take a meal?" the Tang Priest suggested, to which
Monkey replied, "Splendid, splendid." The four of them then went inside, and this is what they saw:
Splendid, towering buildings,
Gleaming bases for statues..
The Buddha hall rise above the clouds;
The monks' cells lie in the moonlit silence.
Red mists circle the stupas;
In the shade of jade−green trees the scripture−wheel is cool.
This is a true Pure Land,
Another Naga Palace,
Where purple mists surround the Mahavira Hall.
The cloisters are never empty of people enjoying the sights,
And visitors climb the pagoda that is always open.
Incense burns in the stand at every moment,
And lamps shine on the altar through the night.
A golden bell rings rhythmically in the abbot's lodgings
As monks worship the Buddha by reciting sutras.
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1265
As the four of them looked around a monk came along the cloister and said to the Tang Priest with polite
gestures of greeting, "Where have you come from, Teacher?"
"From the Tang Court in China," the Tang Priest replied, at which the monk went down on his knees to
kowtow, only to be quickly helped up by the Tang Priest, who asked, "Why do you perform this great
courtesy, reverend abbot?"
"All the lovers of goodness here who read the sutras and recite the name of the Buddha hope to achieve
rebirth in your land of China, so that when I saw you coming in your magnificent mitre and robes I was
certain that your present splendor must be the result of your successful cultivation in earlier lives. That's why
it is right to kowtow to you."
"It alarmed me," said the Tang Priest with a smile, "it alarmed me. I am only an itinerant monk, and know no
splendor at all. To be able to live at your leisure and ease as you do, abbot, is real bliss." The monk then led
the Tang Priest to worship the Buddha statues in the main hall. It was only now that Sanzang called for his
disciples. After seeing their master start talking to the monk, Monkey and the other two had been standing in a
group with their faces averted, holding the horse's bridle and looking after the luggage, so that the monk had
not noticed them.
But when they turned round on hearing the Tang Priest's call the sight of them so frightened the monk that he
called out, "My lord, why are your distinguished disciples so hideously ugly?"
"Ugly they may be," the Tang Priest replied, "but they do have some magical powers. I have been very
grateful for their protection all the way along the journey."
As they were speaking more monks came out to greet them. The monk who had been the first to welcome the
visitors explained to the others, "This teacher has come from Great Tang in China, and these three gentlemen
are his distinguished disciples."
"Teacher," said the others with mixed pleasure and apprehension, "why have you come here from Great
China?"
"I have been commanded by the Tang emperor to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Western
Heaven," Sanzang replied. "As I was passing this way I have come to your monastery to ask where we are and
take a vegetarian meal before setting out again." The monks were all delighted, and they invited the visitors
into the abbot's lodgings, where there were some more monks who were performing ceremonies on behalf of
benefactors.
The monk who had met them first went on to explain to the others, "Come and have a look at what people
from China are like: some are handsome and some are ugly. The beauty of the handsome ones could never be
caught in a painting or drawing, and the ugly ones look really weird." Both the monks and the benefactors all
came to greet them, after which everyone sat down.
When tea had been drunk the Tang Priest inquired, "What is this fine country called?"
"This is Jinping, one of the outer prefectures of India," the monks replied.
"How far is it from this prefecture to Vulture Peak?" the Tang Priest asked. "It is about seven hundred miles
from here to the capital," the monks replied, "and we have walked that distance. As we haven't gone further
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1266
West to Vulture Peak we don't know how far that is and would not like to make a wild guess." The Tang
Priest thanked them.
A little later a vegetarian meal was provided, after which the Tang Priest wanted to be on his way, only to be
pressed to stay by the monks and the benefactors who said, "Teacher, you must stay for a couple of days or so.
Enjoy the Full Moon Festival before you go on your way."
"On my journey I have only been aware of mountains and rivers and the danger of running into ogres or
monsters," the Tang Priest replied, "and I have lost my sense of time. I don't know when Full Moon is."
"It's because your heart is so set on worshipping the Buddha and on enlightenment that you have not thought
about it, Teacher," the monks replied. "Today is the thirteenth of the first month and the lanterns will be tried
out tonight. The day after tomorrow is the fifteenth, when the festival begins, and it goes on till the lanterns
are put away on the eighteenth or nineteenth. We enjoy celebrations here and our prefect, who cares for the
people, has lanterns set out everywhere and music played all night. We also have a Bridge of Golden
Lamps−−it's an ancient tradition that still flourishes. If you will stay for a few days, my lords, our monastery
can certainly afford to entertain you." The Tang Priest had no choice but to stay. As the bell and drum in the
Buddha hall resounded to the skies the faithful came in from the streets bringing lanterns to present to the
Buddha. The Tang Priest and the rest of them came out of the abbot's lodgings to look at the lanterns, after
which everyone turned in.
The next day, when they had eaten the vegetarian breakfast the monks of the monastery brought them, they
strolled in the garden at the back. It really was a lovely place:
It is the first month of the year,
The beginning of the spring.
The wooded garden is quiet and elegant;
The beauty of the scene subdued.
Throughout the four seasons flowers and trees contend;
Turquoise peaks rise behind each other.
Fragrant flowers are growing before the steps,
And scent comes from the plum−tree's branches.
Where there is red it joins the tender peach blossom;
Where there is green it mingles with the willows' fresh green.
Forget about the splendor of the Gold Valley Garden;
Say nothing of the Wang River landscapes painted by Wang Wei.
In the flowing stream
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1267
The wild ducks bob and rise;
Among bamboos by the thousand
Poets ponder their choice of words.
Tree and herbaceous peonies, myrtle, fleeting−smile flowers,
That waken when their time is due;
Camellias, red plum blossom, winter jasmine and daphne,
All early to open out their beauty.
The snow piled by the hidden cliff seems frozen solid still;
The clouds that drift by the distant trees already bring early traces of spring.
The deer sees its reflection beside the pool;
Cranes come to hear the lute beneath the pines.
A few halls and pavilions to East and West,
Where travelers may stay;
Buildings and pagodas to North and South
Where monks may meditate in peace.
Among the flowers
Are one or two houses to nourish one's nature,
Where double eaves rise above each other.
Amid the hills and streams
Are three or four cells in which to reline magic, Peaceful and light.
This is indeed a natural spot for a recluse:
Why look elsewhere for the earthly paradise?
After a day enjoying the garden they inspected the lanterns in the Buddha hall before going to look at the
lantern festival. This is what they saw:
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1268
A splendid city of agate,
A fairyland of glass;
Palaces of crystal and mica,
Like layer upon layer of brocade,
Openwork carving behind openwork carving.
The dazzling bridge of stars moved heaven and earth
While trees of fire made waves of red
Flutes and drums played in the streets.
A moon like a ring of jade hung over a thousand gates;
Fragrant breezes blew through ten thousand homes.
There were giant turtle peaks soaring on high,
Fishes and dragons emerging from the sea,
Phoenixes sporting in the sky.
As all admired the moon and the lanterns
The atmosphere was full of harmony.
Among the crowds dressed in fine silks
All enjoyed the songs and panpipes.
Carriages rumbled along.
There was no end of beautiful faces,
Dashing gallants, And marvellous sights.
When Sanzang and the others had looked at the lanterns in the monastery they wandered around the streets of
the Eastern suburb, not going back to bed till the second watch in the middle of the night.
The next day Sanzang said to the monks, "I made a vow to sweep pagodas, and on the occasion of tonight's
Moon Festival I would like to ask the reverend abbot to open the doors of the pagoda to allow me to fulfil this
vow." The monks opened the doors, and when Friar Sand fetched his cassock and brought it to him on the
ground floor he put it over his shoulders and prayed to the Buddha. Then he swept the ground floor with a
broom, took the cassock off and gave it back to Friar Sand. He swept the second story next, and so on story by
story till he reached the top. In every story there was a Buddha, and in each one he opened all the windows,
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1269
swept the floor, and enjoyed the splendid views. By the time he had finished sweeping and come down again
it was late and all the lamps had been lit.
It was now the night of the full moon. "Venerable teacher," the monks said, "last night you only saw the lamps
in our humble monastery and the outskirts of the city. As tonight is the main festival why don't we go into the
city to see the golden lamps there?" The Tang Priest was glad to follow this suggestion, and he went with his
three disciples and the monks of the monastery into the city to see the lanterns. Indeed:
On the festive fifteenth night
The harmony of spring begins with the first full moon.
Decorated lanterns hang in the busy markets
As all sing the songs of a world at peace.
Over the lantern light in streets and markets
The moon's round mirror rises in the sky
Like a silver dish, driven by the charioteer Ping Yi.
The lanterns were like a brocade carpet woven by fairies;
The lanterns were reflected by the moon,
Doubling its brilliance;
The moon shone on the lanterns,
Making them resplendent.
There was no end of iron−chain star bridges,
Lantern flowers and trees of fire.
Snowflake lanterns,
Plum−blossom lanterns,
Like fragments of ice in spring;
Embroidered screen lanterns,
Painted screen lanterns,
Made up from every color.
Walnut lanterns,
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1270
Lotus lanterns,
Hung high on lantern towers;
Blue lion lanterns,
White elephant lanterns,
Fixed on lofty frames.
Shrimp lanterns,
Terrapin lanterns,
Placed in front of awnings;
Goat lanterns,
Hare lanterns,
Bringing the eaves to life.
Eagle lanterns,
Phoenix lanterns,
Lined up next to each other;
Tiger lanterns,
Horse lanterns,
Being carried along together.
Red−crowned crane lanterns,
White deer lanterns,
Carrying the Star of Longevity;
Goldfish lanterns,
Whale lanterns,
On which rode the poet Li Bai.
Giant turtle mountain lanterns,
Where gods and immortals gathered;
Revolving horse lanterns
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1271
On which warriors joined combat.
The towers of lanterns on thousands of houses
Made a world of clouds and smoke for several miles.
On one side, shining reins and flying jade saddles;
On the other, rumbling carriages leave fragrance behind.
On the red balcony,
Leaning against the railings,
Behind the curtains,
Shoulder to shoulder,
Hand in hand,
Pairs of beauties were eager for the fun.
By the bridge over green waters,
Noisy,
Many−coloured,
Drunken,
Laughing
Couples enjoyed the brilliant sights.
All of the city's flutes and drums were playing;
Panpipes and songs went on all night.
There is also this poem as evidence:
Amid the fine brocades, of lotus were the songs;
This blessed land at peace was full of many throngs.
The lanterns and the moon upon this festive night
Foretold rich harvests after rain and wind just right.
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1272
This was a night when the curfew was relaxed, so that there were huge crowds and a great commotion. People
were dancing, walking on stilts, wearing masks and riding elephants, pushing and crowding to East and to
West as they looked all around. When they reached the bridge of golden lamps the Tang Priest and the monks
pushed forward for a look and saw that it consisted of three golden lamps each the size of a water vat and
shaped like a two−storied pavilion with a light shining out through intricate gold and silver filigree openwork.
Glazed ceramic tiles inside the lamps reflected their light. They were so bright they outshone the moon, and
their oil was very fragrant.
"What sort of oil do those lamps burn?" the Tang Priest asked the monks, "and why does it smell so
remarkably good?"
"You wouldn't know that, Teacher," the monks replied. "There is a county near this prefecture called Mintian.
In the whole county there are 240 wards, and when we have our annual assignment of jobs to be done for the
state, 240 households have to provide oil. All the other jobs assigned by the prefecture or county are
reasonable enough, but these oil households have a very hard time. Every household has to take it on for a
year, and it costs them over two hundred ounces of silver. The oil isn't ordinary oil but perfumed refined
butter oil. One ounce costs two ounces of silver and a pound costs thirty−two ounces. Each of the lamps holds
five hundred pounds of oil, making 1,500 pounds for the three of them, costing 48,000 ounces of silver. With
other miscellaneous expenses it comes to over 50,000 ounces. And that only lasts three nights."
"How can so much oil be used up in only three nights?" Monkey asked.
"In each lamp there are forty−nine big wicks about the size of an egg made of rushes wrapped in silk floss,"
the monks explained. "When they have burned for one night the Lord Buddhas appear, the oil all vanishes and
the lamp goes out."
"I suppose the Lord Buddhas take all the oil," said Pig with a grin as he stood at one side.
"That's right," the monks replied, "that's what everyone in the city has always said ever since ancient times. If
the oil runs dry they say that the Buddhas have taken the oil and the crops will certainly be bountiful; but if it
doesn't dry up on one occasion there will be famine, drought and the wrong weather at the wrong time in that
year. That's why everyone makes this offering."
As they were talking there was the howling of a wind up in the air, sending everyone who was admiring the
lanterns fleeing in terror. The monks could not hold their ground either. "Let's go back, venerable teacher,"
they said, "the wind's here. It's the Lord Buddhas bringing blessings. They're here to see the lanterns."
"How can you tell that?" the Tang Priest asked.
"It's the same every year," the monks replied. "The wind blows up before the third watch. Everybody gets out
of the way as they know that it is the Lord Buddhas bringing down blessings."
"I am one who thinks of, invokes and worships Buddhas," the Tang Priest said. "If the Buddhas are honoring
us with their presence on this festive occasion it would be wonderful to be able to worship them." He rejected
the monks' repeated urgings to go back, and a little later the forms of three Buddhas appeared in the wind and
approached the lamps. The Tang Priest was so excited that he ran to the top of the lamp bridge and threw
himself down worship.
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1273
Brother Monkey rushed forward in alarm to drag him to his feet and say, "They're no good, Master. I'm sure
they're evil." Before the words were even out of his mouth the lamps all went out as with a great whoosh the
Tang Priest was swept up by the wind. It was terrible! Who knew what evil monsters from what cave in what
mountain had been posing as Buddhas to watch the golden lamps?
Pig and Friar Sand were thrown into such panic that they rushed all about, searching and calling for their
master. "Brothers," called Monkey, "no use shouting here. The master's bliss has turned to disaster. He's been
carried off by evil spirits."
"How can you tell that, my lord," the appalled monks asked.
"You're just a bunch of mortals," Monkey replied with a grin, "so you haven't realized what's been happening
all these years. The evil spirits have fooled you into thinking they're true Buddhas coming down to accept the
offerings of lamps. The Buddhas that appeared when the wind blew just now were three evil spirits. My
master didn't realize who they were, so he went up on the top of the bridge to worship them. They covered up
all the lights and carried him off together with the oil in the lamps. As I was a bit too late the three of them got
away by wind."
"Brother," said Friar Sand, "Whatever are we to do?"
"Not a moment to lose," said Monkey. "You two go back the monastery with the monks and look after the
horse and the luggage. I'm going after them while this wind's still blowing."
The splendid Great Sage then shot up by his somersault cloud into mid air, picked up the stench of the wind
and headed Northeast in pursuit, carrying on till all of a sudden the wind dropped at dawn. A great mountain
could be seen, a most steep, towering and splendid mountain:
Many a foothill and ravine,
Twisting and bending streams.
Creepers hang from the beetling precipice,
Pine and cypress rise from the lonely rock.
Cranes cry in the morning mists,
Wild geese call among the clouds at dawn.
Jutting peaks like a row of halberds,
Jagged crags of interlocking rocks.
The summits rise to eighty thousand feet,
And sheer−walled ridges make a thousand angles.
Wild flowers and noble trees all flourish with the spring;
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1274
Cuckoo and oriole respond to the scenery with song.
Majestic beauty,
Towering grandeur,
Steep, grotesque crags hard to climb.
One will stay there long in silence:
All that can be heard are tigers and leopards breathing.
River deer and white deer wander around;
Jade−coloured hares and gray wolves come and go.
The stream in the deep ravine will flow for a million miles;
Twisting torrents splash loud against the rocks.
While the Great Sage was on the top of a scar looking for his way he saw four people coming from the
Western slopes driving three goats and all shouting, "New Year." Monkey's fiery eyes with their golden pupils
flashed as he took a closer look to see that they were the four Duty Gods of the year, the month, the day and
the hour in disguise.
The Great Sage then pulled out his iron cudgel, shook it till it was as thick as a ricebowl and about twelve feet
long and sprang down from the cliff with a shout of, "Where are you skulking off to like that, trying to hide
your faces?"
When the four Duty Gods realized that he had rumbled them they at once turned back into their normal selves,
kowtowed beside the path and said, "Forgive us, Great Sage, forgive us."
"Just because I haven't had any jobs for you recently you thought I was getting lax and so you've all become
very casual," Monkey said. "You didn't even greet me. It's outrageous! Why aren't you giving my master your
secret protection? Where are you going?"
"Because your master somewhat forgot his dhyana nature and was so eager to enjoy himself in the Clouds of
Compassion Monastery in Jinping Prefecture," the Duty Gods said, "he met with evil at the height of splendor,
his joy turned to disaster, and he was captured by the evil spirits. The Defenders of the Faith are looking after
him at the moment. We realized that you would be coming after him this very night, Great Sage, and we came
here to report to you in case you did not know the mountains and forests here."
"If you were here to report," said Brother Monkey, "why did you disguise your identities, why were you
driving three goats, and what were you shouting and yelling for?"
"The three goats were for luck at the beginning of the year.
They are to drive away the evil that's obstructing your master."
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1275
Monkey had been absolutely determined to beat them, but on hearing this explanation he let them off and put
his cudgel away as his fury turned to delight. "Are there evil spirits on this mountain?" he asked. "Yes," they
replied, "yes. This mountain is called Green Dragon Mountain and there's a cave in it called the Dark Essence
Cave where three evil spirits live. The oldest is called King Cold−avoider, the second is called King
Heat−avoider and the third is called King Dust−avoider. They've lived here for a thousand years and have
been fond of refined butter oil since they were children. Ever since they became spirits some years ago they've
been pretending to be Buddhas to trick the officials and people of Jinping into setting out those golden lamps
full of the refined butter oil that they take in their Buddha guises in the middle of every first month. When
they saw your master this time they realized that he was a holy monk and carried him off to the cave too. Any
day now they'll slice off his flesh to fry in the refined butter. You must use your skills to save him as soon as
possible."
On hearing this Monkey dismissed the four Duty Gods with a shout and went round the mountain looking for
the cave. Within a mile or two he saw a rock face by a gill, at the foot of which was a stone building with a
pair of stone doors that stood ajar. Beside the doors was a stone tablet on which was inscribed
GREEN DRAGON MOUNTAIN
DARK ESSENCE CAVE
Not daring to go in uninvited, Monkey stopped and called, "Give me my master back at once, monster." With
a great noise the doors burst wide open, and out rushed a crowd of bull−headed demons who glared as they
asked, "Who are you, yelling here like that?"
"I'm the senior disciple of the holy monk Tang Sanzang who's come from Great Tang in the East to fetch
scriptures," Monkey replied. "He was looking at the lanterns in Jinping along our way when your chief
demons carried him off here. Give him back at once if you want me to spare your lives. If you don't I'll turn
our den upside−down and turn all you demons into just pus and blood."
As soon as the junior demons heard this they rushed inside to report, "Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster!" The
three old evil spirits had taken Sanzang into the depths of the cave and with no further ado were telling their
underlings to strip him and wash him with water from the torrent. They were just about to have him sliced and
diced into tiny pieces to fry in the refined butter when they heard the report of disaster from outside. The
oldest demon king asked with some alarm what had happened.
"There's a hairy−faced monk who looks like a thunder god outside," the junior devils replied. "He's shouting
that Your Majesties carried his master here and wants him given back straight away if our lives are to be
spared. Otherwise he'll turn our den upside−down and turn us all into pus and blood."
This news shocked the demon kings, who all said, "We've only just caught the wretch, and haven't even asked
him his name and his background. Little ones, dress him again and bring him here to be questioned. We must
find out who he is and where he's from."
A crowd of devils untied the Tang Priest, put his clothes back on and pushed him to before the thrones, where
he fell to his knees, trembling with fear, and pleaded, "Spare my life, Your Majesties, spare my life."
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1276
"Where are you from, monk?" the three evil spirits said, all talking at once, "and why did you rush into the
way of our clouds instead of avoiding the Buddha images?"
"I have been sent by the Great Tang Emperor in the East to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures
from the Great Thunder Monastery in India," Sanzang replied with kowtows. "When I went into the Clouds of
Compassion Monastery for a vegetarian meal the monks there pressed me to stay to see the lanterns at the
Moon Festival. Seeing Your Majesties appearing as Buddhas from the bridge of golden lamps I kowtowed to
you because my mortal eyes took you for real Buddhas. That's why I got in the way of your clouds, Your
Majesties."
"How long was the journey from your country in the East to here?" the evil spirits asked. "How many people
have you got with you? What are they called? Tell us the truth straight away and we'll spare your life."
"My secular name was Chen Xuanzang," the Tang Priest replied, "and I was a monk in the Jinshan Monastery
from boyhood. Later I was given official rank as a monk in the Hongfu Monastery in Chang'an. When the
minister Wei Zheng beheaded the Dragon King of the River Jing in his dream and the Tang emperor came
back to life after his travels in the underworld, a Great Land and Water Mass was held for the rebirth of souls.
The Tang emperor chose me to officiate at this ceremony and expound the great principles. The Bodhisattva
Guanyin appeared during the mass and informed me that in the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven
there are three stores of true scriptures that can carry the dead up to Heaven. I was sent to fetch them and
given the title Sanzang, or "Three Stores." As I use Tang as my surname people call me Tang Sanzang. I have
three disciples. The first one is called Sun Wukong the Novice, and he is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven
who has been converted to the truth."
This news came as a shock to the evil spirits, who asked, "Did this Great Sage Equaling Heaven make great
havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago?"
"Yes, yes," the Tang Priest said. "The second one is called Zhu Wuneng or Zhu Bajie. He is Marshal Tian
Peng come down to earth. The third is Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand, the Curtain−lifting General in mortal
reincarnation."
"It's as well we haven't eaten him yet," the evil spirits all exclaimed in horror. "Little ones, lock the Tang
Priest in iron chains at the back. When we've caught his three disciples we'll eat them together." They then
mustered a force of armed yak, water−buffalo and ox spirits to go outside carrying bugles, waving banners
and beating drums.
Once the three evil spirits were fully clad in their armor they went out and shouted, "Who's that who dares
come here shouting like that?" Monkey slipped round behind the scar to have a good look, and this is what the
evil spirits were like:
Multi−coloured faces, round eyes,
Towering horns.
Four sharp−pointed ears,
Neat and shining bright.
Bodies patterned like a painting,
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1277
Covered with brocades that shine like fireflies.
The first one wore a hat of foxes' fur
And hot steam rose from the long hairs of his face.
The second wore a flaming cloak of lightest gauze
And had four gleaming, jade−like hooves.
The third had a mighty roar like thunder;
His sharp and pointed fangs were just like silver needles.
Each was brave and fierce
As they carried their three weapons;
One used a battle−axe,
One was an expert in the cutlass,
And the third had a knotted flail resting on his shoulders.
The other evil spirits, tall and short, fat and thin, senior and junior, were all cattle−headed monsters carrying
spears or clubs. There were three big banners clearly inscribed with the words "King Cold−avoider," "King
Heat−avoider" and "King Dust−avoider." After looking at all this for a while Monkey lost his patience and
went up to them with a shout of, "Can you recognize Monkey, thieving damned ogres?"
"Are you the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven?" the evil spirits shouted back. "It really is a case of
I heard your name before I saw your face:
The sight of that would bring the gods disgrace.
So all you are is a macaque."
"I'll get you, you lamp−oil thieves," Monkey retorted in high dudgeon. "Don't talk such rubbish, you
smooth−tongued monsters. Give my master back at once." With that he advanced and swung his iron cudgel,
to be parried by the old demons who raised their weapons to meet the blow. A splendid fight ensued in the
mountain hollow:
Battle−axe, cutlass and flail
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1278
Met by the Monkey King's lone cudgel.
Cold−avoider, Heat−avoider and Dust−avoider
Had heard of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.
When the cudgel rose it scared demons and gods;
Axe and cutlass hacked and flew.
A primal dharma image of true emptiness
Holding off three demons masquerading as Buddhas.
Their noses all greasy with this year's stolen oil,
They tried to snatch the monk sent by the emperor.
One for his master's sake feared not the lengthy road;
The others in their greed had lamps offered every year.
All that could be beard was clash of axe and cutlass
And the noisy clatter of the cudgel.
With clashes and lunges three fought against one
As each showed his skill with blocks and parries.
They fought from dawn till almost nightfall
And a victor had yet to emerge in the struggle.
By the time Monkey's cudgel had gone 150 rounds with the three demons it was nearly evening and the
outcome was still in doubt. Then Dust−avoider sprang forward from the ranks with a swing of his flail and
waved a flag, whereupon the crowd of cattle−headed demons swarmed round Monkey, encircling him and
swinging wildly at him with their weapons. Seeing that things were going badly, Monkey set off his
somersault cloud and fled in a whoosh. The demons did not go after him but called their devils back so that
everyone could have an evening meal. They told the junior devils to take a bowl of food to Sanzang as well:
he was not to be dealt with until Monkey had been caught. As the master was a lifelong vegetarian and was
besides feeling miserable he sobbed and let none of the food touch his lips.
The story tells how Monkey rode his cloud back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery and called,
"Brothers."
Journey to the West
Chapter 91 1279
On hearing this Pig and Friar Sand, who were waiting for him and discussing what to do, came out together to
greet him with the words, "Brother, why are you only back now after being away all day? What's happened to
the master?"
"I followed the smell of the wind right through the night till we got to a mountain and it disappeared,"
Monkey replied with a smile. "Luckily the four Duty Gods told me that the mountain's called Green Dragon
Mountain and that there's a Dark Essence Cave on it where three evil spirits live: King Cold−avoider, King
Heat−avoider and King Dust−avoider. They've been stealing the oil here for years on end by disguising
themselves as Buddhas to trick the officials of Jinping Prefecture. When they came across us this year they
wickedly carried our master off with them. I told the Duty Gods and the rest of them to give the master some
secret protection while I shouted insults at them from outside their doors. When the three demons came out
they all looked like bullheaded demons. The first of them fought with a battle−axe, the second with a cutlass
and the third with a flail. They had a whole gang of cattle−headed monsters with them, waving banners and
beating drums. The fight went on all day and was still in the balance when one of the demon kings waved a
flag to bring all the junior devils forward. As it was late and I was worried that I couldn't beat them I came
back by somersault cloud."
"I reckon it must be the Demon King of Fengdu who's making trouble for you," said Pig.
"What makes you guess that?" Friar Sand asked. "I can tell because our big brother said they were all
cattle−headed monsters," replied Pig with a laugh.
"No, no," said Monkey. "I saw them and they were all rhinoceros spirits."
"If they're rhinos we've just got to catch them and saw their horns off," said Pig. "They'll be worth quite a bit
of silver."
As they were talking the monks all asked Monkey if he had eaten any supper. "I'll have something if it's no
trouble," Brother Monkey replied, "but I can do without just as well."
"Surely you're hungry after fighting all day, my lord," the monks said.
"You can't get hungry in a mere day," Monkey laughed. "I once went without food for five hundred years."
The monks did not know whether he was telling the truth or joking, and a little later food was brought in that
Monkey ate, after which he said, "Tidy up and go to sleep. We'll go and fight them again tomorrow and
capture the demon kings so as to rescue the master."
"What nonsense, brother," said Friar Sand, who was standing to one side. "As the saying goes, 'Delay brings
wisdom.' It'll be terrible if that monster stays awake tonight and murders the master. We'd better go there right
now and make such a row that he can't do anything. It may go badly wrong if we lose a single moment."
When Pig heard this he braced himself and said, "Friar Sand's right. Let's go and put down those demons. The
moon's bright enough." Accepting their advice, Monkey left his instructions with the monks of the monastery.
"Look after the luggage and the horse. When we've captured the evil spirits we'll bring them back here to
prove to the prefect that they're imposters. Then he can end the oil levy and relieve the common people of this
hardship. That'll be a good thing, won't it?" The monks all accepted their orders while the three of them left
the city by auspicious cloud. Indeed:

Idleness and unrestraint
Threw the dhyana into confusion;
Danger and catastrophe

Three Monks Wage a Great Fight on Green Dragon Mountain
Four Stars Seize the Rhinoceros Monsters
The story tells how after the Great Sage Monkey took his two brother disciples by gale and cloud to the
Northeast they were soon bringing their cloud down at the entrance to the Dark Essence Cave on Green
Dragon Mountain. Pig was just about to smash the doors in when Monkey said, "Wait a moment. I'll go in and
find out whether the master's still alive before we have it out with him."
"But the doors are shut very tightly," said Friar Sand. How will you get in?"
"I've got my methods," Monkey replied.
The splendid Great Sage then put his cudgel away, made a spell with his fingers while saying the magic
words, called "Change!" and turned into a fire−fly. He was really nimble. Just look at him:
Wings that shine like shooting stars:
The ancients say fire−flies grow from rotting plants.
His powers of transformation are truly great,
And he loves to wander all around.
When he flies to the stone doors to look within
A draft blows through the crack beside him.
A single jump and he is in the dark courtyard,
Watching the movements of the evil spirits.
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1281
As he flew in he saw some cattle sprawled around on the ground, fast asleep and snoring like thunder. In the
main hall nothing was moving, and all the doors were closed. Not knowing where the three evil spirits were
sleeping, he went through the hall and shone with his light into the back, where he heard sobs. The Tang
Priest was chained to a pillar under the eaves at the back and weeping. Monkey kept out of sight as he listened
to what he was crying about, and this is what he heard:
"Since I left Chang'an in China some ten years back and more,
I have had to suffer much crossing all those rivers and mountains.
I came out to the West at a very happy season,
Arriving in the city for the festival of lanterns.
"I failed to understand that the Buddhas were impostors
All because my fate seems to doom me to distress.
My disciples gave pursuit and will use their mighty powers:
I pray they will be able to achieve a great success."
Delighted to hear this, Monkey spread his wings and flew closer to his master, who wiped away his tears and
observed, "Goodness, the West really is different. This is only the first month of the year, when dormant
insects are just beginning to wake up. Fancy seeing a fire−fly now!"
"Master," said Brother Monkey, unable to keep quiet any longer, "I'm here."
"I was just wondering how there could be a fire−fly at this time of year, and it's you," the Tang Priest replied
with delight.
"Master," said Monkey, turning back into himself, "the journey's been held up so long and so much effort has
been wasted because you can't tell true from false. All the way along I've told you demons are no good, but
you will kowtow to them. When those devils covered up the lamps to steal the refined butter oil they carried
you off too. I told Pig and Friar Sand to go back to the monastery and keep an eye on our things while I
followed the smell of the wind here. I didn't know what the place was called, but luckily the four Duty Gods
told me that this is Dark Essence Cave on Green Dragon Mountain. I fought the monsters all day long till I
went back at evening, told my brother−disciples the full story, and came back here with them instead of going
to bad. As I thought it was too late at night to fight and didn't know where you were I transformed myself to
come in and find out what's going on."
"Are Pig and Friar Sand outside?" the happy Tang Priest asked.
"Yes," Monkey replied. "I've just had a look around and seen that the evil spirits are all asleep. I'll unlock you,
smash the doors down and get you out." The Tang Priest nodded his head in gratitude.
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1282
Using his unlocking magic, Monkey made the lock open at a touch. He was just leading his master to the front
of the cave when the demon kings could be heard shouting from their bedrooms, "Shut the doors tight, little
ones, and be careful of fire. Why can't we hear the watchmen calling the watches? Where are the clappers and
bells?"
After a day's hard fighting the junior demons were all asleep, exhausted; and they only woke up when they
heard the shout. To the sound of clappers and bells several of them came out from the back holding weapons
and beating gongs, and they just happened to bump into Monkey and his master.
"Where do you think you're going, my fine monks, now you've broken the locks?" the junior devils all
shouted together, and with no further argument Monkey pulled out his cudgel, shook it to make it as thick as a
rice bowl and struck, killing two of them at a blow. The rest of them dropped their weapons, went to the
central hall, beat on the doors and shouted, "Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster. The hairy−faced monk's got
inside and he's killing people."
The moment the three demons heard this they tumbled out of their beds and ordered, "Catch them! Catch
them!" This gave the Tang Priest such a fright that his hands and legs turned weak. Monkey abandoned him
and stormed his way forward, swinging his cudgel.
The junior devils could not stop him as, pushing two or three aside here and knocking two or three over there,
he smashed several pairs of doors open and rushed straight out, shouting, "Where are you, brothers?"
Pig and Friar Sand greeted him, rake and staff raised for action, with the question, "What's up, brother?"
Monkey told them all about how he had transformed himself to rescue the master, been found by the spirits
when they woke up, and been forced to abandon him and fight his way out.
Now that they had recaptured the Tang Priest, the demon kings had him locked up in chains again and
questioned him in the glare of lamplight, as they brandished cutlass and axe. "How did you open the lock,
damn you," they asked, "and how did that ape get inside? Confess this moment and we'll spare your life, or
else we'll cut you in half."
This so terrified the Tang Priest that he fell to his knees shivering and shaking and said, "Your Majesties, my
disciple Sun Wukong can do seventy−two kinds of transformations. Just now he turned into a fire−fly and
flew in to rescue me. We never realized that Your Majesties would wake up or that we would bump into Their
Junior Majesties. My wicked disciple wounded a couple of them, and when they all started shouting and going
for us with weapons and torches he abandoned me and escaped."
"If we'd woken up earlier he'd never have got away," the three demon kings said with loud guffaws. They then
told their underlings to fasten the doors firmly at front and back and stop shouting.
"As they've shut the doors and stopped shouting I think they must be going to murder the master," said Friar
Sand. "We must act."
"You're right," said Pig. "Let's smash the doors," The idiot showed off his magical powers by smashing the
stone doors to smithereens with a blow from his rake then shouted at the top of his voice, "Thieving,
oil−stealing monsters! Send my master out right now!"
This gave the junior devils inside the doors such a fright that they tumbled and ran inside to report, "Disaster,
Your Majesties, disaster. The monks have smashed the front doors."
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1283
"They're outrageous, damn them," the three demon kings said in a great fury, and when they had sent for their
armor and fastened it on they took their weapons and led their underlings into battle. It was now about the
third watch of the night, and the moon in the middle of the sky made all as bright as day. As they led their
forces out they wasted no more words and started fighting. Monkey held off the battle−axe, Pig blocked the
cutlass, and Friar Sand took on the flail.
Three monks with cudgel, staff and rake;
Three evil monsters both brave and angry.
The battle−axe, the cutlass and the flail
Made howling winds and set the sand flying.
In their first clashes they breathed out baleful mists,
Then as they flew around they scattered coloured clouds.
The nailed rake went through its routines round the body,
The iron cudgel was even more splendidly heroic,
And the demon−quelling staff was something rarely seen on earth;
But the unrepentant ogres would not yield a foot of ground.
The bright−bladed axe had a sharp−pointed butt,
The whirling flail made a pattern of flowers,
And the flashing cutlass swung like a painted door;
But the monks were their match.
One side was fighting with fury for their master's life;
The other hit at their faces so as not to release the Tang Priest.
The axe hacked and the cudgel blocked in the struggle for mastery;
The rake swung and the cutlass struck as they fought;
The knotted flail and the demon−quelling staff,
Coming and going in a splendid display.
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1284
When the three monks and the three monsters had been fighting for a long time without either side coming out
on top King Cold−avoider shouted, "Come on, little ones!" The monsters all charged at Pig, quickly tripping
him up and bringing him to the ground. Several water−buffalo spirits dragged and pulled him inside the cave,
where they tied him up. When Friar Sand saw that Pig had disappeared and heard the mooing of all the cattle
he then raised his staff, feinted at King Dust−avoider and tried to flee, only to be rushed by another crowd of
spirits who pulled at him, sending him staggering. However hard he struggled he could not get up, and he too
was carried off to be tied up. Realizing that he was in an impossible situation, Monkey escaped by somersault
cloud.
When Pig and Friar Sand were dragged to him the Tang Priest said with tears welling up in his eyes at the
sight of them, "Poor things! You two have been caught too. Where's Wukong?"
"When he saw we'd been caught he ran away," Friar Sand replied.
"Wherever he has gone he will certainly have gone to fetch help," said the Tang Priest. "But who knows when
we will be delivered?" Master and disciples felt thoroughly miserable.
The story tells how Brother Monkey rode his somersault cloud back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery,
where the monks met him with the question, "Have you been able to rescue Lord Tang?"
"It's difficult," said Monkey, "very difficult. Those three evil spirits have tremendous magical powers, and
when we three had fought them for a long time they called up their underlings to capture Pig and Friar Sand. I
was lucky to get away."
"My lord," said the monks with horror, "if someone who can ride mists and clouds as you can couldn't catch
them, your master is bound to be killed."
"No problem," Monkey replied, "no problem. My master's under the secret protection of the Protectors, the
Guardians, the Dings and the Jias. He has besides eaten Grass−returning Cinnabar. I'm sure his life will be
safe. The only trouble is that those demons really know their stuff. You people look after the horse and the
luggage while I go up to Heaven to get some troops."
"Can you go up to Heaven, my lord?" asked the terrified monks.
"I used to live there," replied Monkey with a smile. "Because I wrecked the Peach Banquet when I was Great
Sage Equaling Heaven, our Buddha subdued me, so that now I've no option but to redeem my crimes by
guarding the Tang Priest while he fetches the scriptures. All along the journey I've been helping the good and
fighting against the evil. What you don't realize is that the master is fated to have these troubles." When the
monks heard this they kowtowed in worship, while Monkey went outside and disappeared with a whistle.
The splendid Great Sage was soon outside the Western Gate of Heaven, where the Metal Planet, Heavenly
King Virudhaka and the four spirit officers Yin, Zhu, Tao and Xu were talking to each other. As soon as they
saw Monkey coming they hastily bowed to him and said, "Where are you going, Great Sage?"
"After we reached Mintian County in Jinping Prefecture on the Eastern borders of India," Monkey replied,
"my master, the Tang Priest who I'm escorting, was being entertained by the monks of the Clouds of
Compassion Monastery for the Full Moon Festival. When we went to the Bridge of Golden Lamps there were
three golden lamps full of over fifty thousand ounces of silver's worth of scented refined butter oil that the
Buddhas came down to take every year. While we were admiring the lamps three Buddha images did come
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1285
down to earth, and my master was gullible enough to go on the bridge to worship them. I told him they were a
bad lot, but by then the lamps had been covered up and the master carried off with the oil by a wind. When I'd
followed the wind till dawn I reached a mountain, where the four Duty Gods fortunately told me that it was
called Green Dragon Mountain with a Dark Essence Cave in it where three monsters lived: King
Cold−avoider, King Heat−avoider and King Dust−avoider. I hurried to their doors to demand the master and
fought them for a while without success, so I got in by transforming myself to find the master locked up but
unharmed. I released him and was just taking him out when they woke up and I had to flee again. Later I
fought hard against them with Pig and Friar Sand, but the two of them were both captured and tied up. That's
why I've come up to inform the Jade Emperor, find out about the monsters' background and ask him to give
orders to have them suppressed."
At this the Metal Planet burst out laughing and said, "If you've been fighting the monsters why can't you tell
where they're from?"
"I can see that," Monkey replied. "They're a bunch of rhino spirits. But they have such enormous magical
powers that I can't beat them and I'm desperate."
"They are three rhinoceros spirits," the Metal Planet explained. "Because their form is seen in heaven they
cultivated their awareness for many years and became true spirits able to fly on clouds and walk in mists.
Those monsters are fanatical about cleanliness and don't like the look of their own bodies, and are always
going into the water to bathe. They have lots of different names: there are she−rhinos, he−rhinos, gelded
rhinos, spotted rhinos, humao rhinos, duoluo rhinos and heaven−connected brindled rhinos. They all have a
single nostril, three types of hair and two horns. They roam the rivers and seas and can travel through water. It
looks as though Cold−avoider, Heat−avoider and Dust−avoider have nobility in their horns, which is why they
call themselves kings. If you want to catch them, they will submit to the four beast stars belonging to the
element wood."
"Which four wood stars?" Monkey asked. "Could I trouble you, venerable sir, to spell it out for me?"
"Those stars are spread out in space outside the Dipper and Bull Palace," the planet replied with a smile. "If
you submit a memorial to the Jade Emperor he will give you detailed instructions." Raising his clasped hands
as he expressed his thanks, Monkey went straight in through the heavenly gates.
He was soon outside the Hall of Universal Brightness, where he saw the heavenly teachers Ge, Qiu, Zhang
and Xu, who asked, "Where are you going?"
"We've just reached Jinping Prefecture," Monkey replied, "where my master relaxed his dhyana nature by
going to enjoy the Moon Festival lanterns and was carried off by evil monsters. As I can't subdue them myself
I've come to ask the Jade Emperor to save him." The four heavenly teachers then took Monkey to the Hall of
Miraculous Mist to submit his memorial, and when all the ceremonials had been performed he explained his
business. The Jade Emperor then asked which units of heavenly soldiers he wanted to help him.
"When I arrived at the Western Gate of Heaven just now," Monkey replied, "the Metal Planet told me they
were rhinoceros spirits that could only be subdued by the four beast stars belonging to the element wood." The
Jade Emperor then told Heavenly Teacher Xu to go to the Dipper and Bull Palace with Monkey to fetch the
four beast stars and take them down to the lower world to make the capture.
By the time they arrived outside the Dipper and Bull Palace the Twenty−eight Constellations were there to
greet them. "We are here by imperial command to order four beast stars belonging to the element wood to go
down to the lower world with the Great Sage Sun," the heavenly teacher explained. The Wooden Lesser
Dragon of the Constellation Horn, the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper, the Wooden Wolf of the Strider, and
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1286
the Wooden Hyena of the Well all stepped forward from the side to ask, "Where are you sending us to subdue
demons, Great Sage?"
"So you're the ones," said Brother Monkey with a smile. "That old man Metal Planet kept your names secret,
and I didn't realize what he was driving at. If he'd told me before that it was you four wooden animals from
the Twenty−eight Constellations I'd have come here to invite you myself: there'd have been no need to trouble
His Majesty for an edict."
"What a thing to say, Great Sage," the four wooden animals replied. "We'd never have dared to leave on our
own authority in the absence of an imperial decree. Where are they? Let's go right away."
"They are rhinoceros spirits in the Dark Essence Cave in Green Dragon Mountain to the Northeast of Jinping
Prefecture."
"If they're really rhinoceros spirits," said the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper, the Wooden Wolf of the Strider
and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn, "you'll only need Wooden Hyena from the Well Constellation.
He can eat tigers on mountains and capture rhinos in the sea."
"But these aren't ordinary rhinos who gaze at the moon," replied Monkey. "They have cultivated their conduct
and found the Way and are a thousand years old. All four of you gentlemen must come: no excuses. If one of
you can't capture them single−handed it'll be wasted effort."
"You people are talking nonsense," the heavenly teacher added. "The imperial command is that all four of you
go, so go you must. Fly there at once while I report back." The heavenly teacher then took his leave of
Monkey and went.
"Delay no more, Great Sage," the four wooden ones said. "You challenge them to battle and lure them out so
we can come from behind you and get them." Monkey then went up to the cave and shouted abusively,
"Oil−thieving ogres! Give my master back!" The doors, which Pig had smashed open, had been barricaded
with a few planks by a number of junior devils, and when they heard his insults they rushed inside to report,
"Your Majesties, the monk Sun is outside insulting us again."
"We beat him and he ran away," said Dust−avoider, "so why's he back again today? I think he must have got
some reinforcements from somewhere."
"We're not scared of any reinforcements he could get," said Cold−avoider and Heat−avoider scornfully. "Let's
get into our armor at once. Little ones, surround him carefully and don't let him get away." Not caring about
their lives, the evil spirits came out of the cave holding spears and swords, with banners waving and drums
beating. "Back again, are you, macaque?" they shouted at Brother Monkey. "Not afraid of another beating?"
Nothing infuriated Monkey so much as the word "macaque," and he was grinding his teeth in rage as he lifted
his cudgel to hit them. The three demon kings brought their junior devils up to surround him, at which the
four wooden beasts who were waiting to one side swung their weapons with shouts of, "Don't move,
animals!"
The three demon kings were of course most alarmed at the sight of the four stars, and they all said, "This is
terrible, terrible. He's found the people who can beat us. Run for your lives, little ones!" With that there was
much roaring, lowing, panting and sighing as the junior devils all resumed their original appearances as yak,
water−buffalo and ox spirits running all over the mountain. The three demon kings also turned back into their
true selves, put their hands down to become four−hoofed creatures like iron cannons, and galloped off to the
Northeast, to be followed hard by the Great Sage leading the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1287
Lesser Dragon of the Horn. While they were not going to relax for a moment, the Wooden Unicorn of the
Dipper and the Wooden Wolf of the Strider were mopping up all the cattle spirits among the hollows,
summits, ravines and valleys of the Eastern mountain. Some were killed and others taken alive. They then
went into the Dark Essence Cave to free the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand.
Recognizing the two stars, Friar Sand bowed to them in thanks and asked, "What brought you two gentlemen
here to rescue us?"
"We came to rescue you because the Great Sage Monkey submitted a request to the Jade Emperor that we be
sent," the two stars replied.
"Why has my disciple Wukong not come in?" the Tang Priest asked with tears in his eyes.
"The three old demons are rhinoceroses," the stars explained, "and when they saw us they fled for their lives
to the Northeast. The Great Sage Sun has gone after them with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the
Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn. We two wiped out the oxen then came here to rescue you, holy monk."
The Tang Priest once again kowtowed in thanks then kowtowed to heaven.
"Master," said Pig, "overdone courtesy is hypocrisy. Stop kowtowing all the time. The four star officers came
at the Jade Emperor's command and as a favour to big brother. The ordinary demons have all been wiped out,
but we still don't know how the senior demons are to be put down. Let's clear all the valuables out of the cave,
wreck the place so as to dig out their roots, then go back to the monastery to wait for Monkey."
"Marshal Tian Peng, your suggestion is right," said the Wooden Wolf of the Strider. "You and the
Curtain−lifting General escort your master back to the monastery to sleep while we head Northeast to fight the
enemy."
"Yes, yes," said Pig. "With you two to help you're bound to wipe them all out. Then you'll be able to report
back on your mission." The two star officers immediately joined the chase. After Pig and Friar Sand had
found a bushel of valuables in the cave−−there was much coral, agate, pearls, amber, precious shells, jade and
gold−−they carried them outside and invited the master to sit on the top of a crag while they started a fire that
burned the whole cave to ashes. Only then did they take the master back to the Clouds of Compassion
Monastery in Jinping Prefecture. Indeed:
The classic says, "Disaster comes at the height of success."
Indeed one can meet with evil in happiness.
For love of the lanterns the dhyana nature was disturbed;
The heart set on the Way was weakened by a beautiful sight.
The great elixir has always had to be permanently guarded;
Once it is lost one always comes to grief.
Shut it up tight; bind it fast; never idle.
A moment's lack of care can lead one astray.
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1288
We will tell not of how the three of them went back to the monastery, their lives saved, but of how the
Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper and the Wooden Wolf of the Strider were riding their clouds Northeast in
pursuit of the demons when they lost sight of them in mid air. On reaching the Western Ocean they saw the
Great Sage Monkey down by the sea a long way away, shouting.
"Where have the monsters gone, Great Sage?" they asked, bringing their clouds down. "Why didn't you two
come after them and help put them down?" Monkey replied. "How can you have the nerve to ask that
question?"
"When we saw that you and the stars from the Well and the Horn had routed the demons and were going after
them, Great Sage," the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper replied, "we were sure you'd capture them, so we two
wiped out the rest of the devils, rescued your master and fellow−disciples from the cave, searched the
mountain, burned the cave out, and entrusted your master to your two fellow−disciples to take back to the
Clouds of Compassion Monastery in the city. We only came after you this way when you had been gone for
such a long time."
"In that case you did very well," said Brother Monkey, his wrath now turned to pleasure. "Thank you for
going to so much trouble. The only thing is that when we'd chased the three ogres this far they plunged into
the sea. The two stars from the Well and the Horn followed close behind them while I stayed on the shore to
cut off their escape. Now you're here you can block them on the shore while I go there."
The splendid Great Sage then swung his cudgel and made a spell with his fingers as he cleared a way through
the waters, plunging deep into the waves, where the three monsters were locked in a life−and−death struggle
with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn.
"Monkey's here," he shouted, springing forward. The evil spirits could barely hold off the two star officers, so
when they heard Monkey's great yell at this moment of crisis they turned and fled for their lives into the
middle of the sea. Their horns were very good at parting the waters, and they cleared their way through the sea
with a whooshing noise, the two star officers and the Great Sage Monkey chasing after them.
A yaksha who was patrolling the Western Ocean with a shelled warrior saw from a distance the way the
rhinoceroses were parting the waters, recognized Monkey and the two stars, and rushed back to the crystal
palace to report to the dragon king in alarm, "Your Majesty, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and two stars
from the sky are chasing three rhinoceroses this way." When the old dragon king Ao Shun heard this he said
to his heir, Prince Mo'ang, "Muster our water forces at once. I'm sure it must be the three rhinoceros spirits
Cold−avoider, Heat−avoider and Dust−avoider who've provoked Sun the Novice. As they're in the sea now
we'd better lend a hand." Having been given his orders Ao Mo'ang hastened to muster his troops.
A moment later a fully−armed force of tortoises, soft−shelled turtles, alligators, bream, mackerel, mandarin
fish, carp, and prawn and crab soldiers charged out of the crystal palace shouting their battle−cries together to
stop the rhinoceros spirits. Unable to go any further forward, the rhinoceroses made a hasty retreat, only to
find their escape blocked by the stars from the Well and the Horn as well as the Great Sage. In their panic they
failed to stay in a group, but scattered as they fled for their lives. Dust−avoider was soon surrounded by the
old dragon king's men.
A delighted Monkey called out, "Stop! Stop! Take him alive! Don't kill him!" When Mo'ang heard this order
he rushed forward, knocked Dust−avoider to the ground, put an iron hook through his snout and tied all his
hoofs together.
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1289
The old dragon king then divided his forces into two to help the star officers capture the other two monsters.
As the young dragon prince led his men forward the Wooden Hyena of the Well reverted to his real form to
hold Cold−avoider down and start eating him in big and little bites.
"Well Star!" Mo'ang shouted. "Don't kill him! The Great Sage Monkey wants him alive, not dead." Mo'ang
shouted several times, but by then the Hyena had already gnawed right through the monster's throat.
Mo'ang ordered his prawn and crab soldiers to carry the dead rhinoceros back to the palace of crystal, then
joined the Wooden Hyena of the Well in the pursuit. Heat−avoider, who was being driven back towards them
by the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn, ran straight into the star from the Well, at which Mo'ang ordered
his tortoises, soft−shelled turtles and alligators to spread out in the winnowing−fan formation to encircle the
monster.
"Spare me, spare me!" the monster pleaded. The wooden Hyena of the Well sprang forward, grabbed the
monster by the ear, seized his sword, and shouted, "I won't kill you. I won't kill you. I'll take you to the Great
Sage Monkey for him to deal with you."
The troops then went back to the crystal palace, where they reported, "We've got them both." Monkey saw
that one was lying headless and gory on the ground, while the other was being forced to kneel by the Wooden
Hyena of the Well twisting his ear.
"That head wasn't cut off with a weapon," Monkey said on going up for a closer look.
"If I hadn't shouted so hard the star officer of the Well would have eaten the whole of him up," replied Mo'ang
with a smile. "Very well then," said Monkey.
"In that case you'd better get a saw to cut off his horns and have his hide removed for us to take. We'll leave
the flesh for your worthy father the dragon king and yourself to enjoy." A chain was then run through
Dust−avoider's nose for the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn to lead him by, and the same was done to
Heat−avoider for the Wooden Hyena of the Well.
"Take them to the prefect of Jinping," said Monkey. "Investigate them, question them about all the years they
masqueraded as Buddhas to harm the people, then off with their heads."
They all then did as Monkey told them, taking their leave of the dragon king and his son and emerging from
the Western Ocean, leading the rhinoceroses with them. When they met the other two stars from the Strider
and the Dipper they went by cloud straight back to Jinping Prefecture.
Here Monkey called out as he stood in mid air on a beam of auspicious light, "Mr. Prefect, subordinate
officials, soldiers and civilians of Jinping, listen to what I say. We are holy monks sent by the Great Tang in
the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. In this prefecture and its counties you have had to
make offerings in golden lamps every year to these rhinoceros monsters pretending to be Buddhas coming
down to earth. When we came here and were admiring the lamps at the Moon Festival these monsters carried
the oil and our master off together. I asked for some gods from heaven to capture them. We've cleaned out
their cave and wiped out the monsters. They won't be able to give you any more trouble. You needn't waste
the people's money making offerings in golden lamps here any more."
When Pig and Friar Sand, who were just escorting the master back into the Clouds of Compassion Monastery,
heard Monkey talking from up in the sky they abandoned their master, dropped the luggage and shot up into
the air by cloud to ask Monkey about how the demons had been beaten.
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1290
"One of them was chewed to death by the star from the Well," Monkey replied, "and we've got his sawn−off
horns and his hide with us. The other two we've brought back alive."
"Throw the pair of them down into the city," said Pig, "for the officials and everyone else to see. Then they'll
know we're gods and sages. I'll trouble you four star officers to put your clouds away, land, and come into the
prefectural court with us to execute the monsters. The facts are clear and the penalty's the right one. There's
nothing else to be said."
"Marshal Tian Peng is right, and he knows the laws too," the four stars said.
"I have learned a bit during my years as a monk," Pig replied.
The gods then pushed the rhinoceroses, which fell wreathed in coloured clouds into the prefectural court, to
the astonishment of the prefectutal officials and everyone else inside and outside the walled city, who all set
up incense tables outside their houses, and bowed their heads to worship the gods from heaven. A little later
the monks of the Clouds of Compassion Monastery carried the venerable elder into the court in a sedan chair.
When Sanzang met Monkey he kept thanking him, adding, "I am very grateful for the trouble I have put the
star officers to in rescuing us. I had been very anxious when I did not see you, worthy disciple, but now you
have returned in triumph. I wonder where you had to chase the monsters to before you caught them."
"After I left you the day before yesterday," Monkey replied, "I went up to heaven to make some enquiries.
The Metal Planet knew that the monsters were rhinoceroses, so he told me to ask for the four beast stars that
belong to the element wood. So I submitted a memorial to the Jade Emperor and he sent them straight to the
mouth of the cave, where they gave battle. When the demon kings fled, the stars from the Dipper and the
Strider rescued you, Master, I chased the demons with the Well and the Horn stars straight to the Western
Ocean, where the dragon king sent his son out with their troops to help us. That's how the monsters were
captured and brought here for questioning." The venerable elder was full of endless praise and thanks. The
prefectural and county officials and their subordinates all lit precious candles and whole containers of incense
sticks as they kowtowed in respect,
A little later Pig lost his temper, pulled out his monastic knife and beheaded first Dust−avoider, then
Heat−avoider, each with a single stroke. Then he removed their four horns with a saw. The Great Sage
Monkey then had another suggestion to make: "You four star officers must take these four rhinoceros horns to
the upper world to offer to the Jade Emperor as trophies when you report back on your mission." As for the
two horns he had brought back from the sea, he said, "We'll leave one here to guard the storehouses of the
prefectural palace and as evidence that from now on no more lamp−oil will ever be levied. We'll take the
other to offer to the Lord Buddha on Vulture Peak." The four stars were delighted, and after bowing to take
their leave of the Great Sage they rose by coloured cloud to report back to the Jade Emperor.
The prefectural and county officials kept the master and his disciples for a great vegetarian banquet to which
all the rural officials were also invited. Notices were issued to tell the military and civil population that golden
lamps were not to be lit the next year, and that the duty of serving as an oil−purchasing household was
abolished for ever. Butchers meanwhile were instructed to remove the rhinoceros skins to be steeped in
saltpeter and smoked dry for making into armor, while the flesh was to be distributed to the officials. At the
same time money and grain that had been raised by unjust fines on innocent people were spent to buy a plot of
privately−owned empty land. On this a temple to the four stars who had put the demons down, as well as a
shrine to the Tang Priest and his three disciples, were to be built. Stone tablets with inscriptions were to be set
up for each of them to record their deeds for ever as a mark of gratitude.
Journey to the West
Chapter 92 1291
Master and disciples relaxed and enjoyed the offerings. They had hardly a moment to themselves as they had
so many invitations from the 240 lamp−oil households. Pig was delighted to have so much to eat, and he
always kept in his sleeve some of the treasures he had collected in the cave to give to all his hosts to thank
them for their banquets. When they had stayed there for a month and were still unable to get away the Tang
Priest ordered Monkey.
"Wukong, give all the remaining valuables to the monks in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery. Let's leave
before dawn, without letting the rich families here know. If we are so eager to enjoy ourselves here that we
delay in fetching the scriptures we may offend the Lord Buddha and cause some catastrophe. That would be
terrible." Monkey then disposed of all the objects.
When they got up early the next morning at the fifth watch Pig was woken up to get the horse ready. The idiot
had eaten and drunk so well that he was still half asleep as he said, "Why get the horse ready so early?"
"The master says we've got to be going," Monkey shouted.
"That reverend gentleman doesn't do things right," the idiot said, rubbing his eyes. "We've had invitations
from all 240 of the big families, but only had thirty or so good vegetarian meals so far. How can he be making
me go hungry again?"
When the venerable elder heard this he retorted abusively, "Dreg−guzzling idiot! Stop talking such nonsense!
Get up at once! If you go on arguing back like that I'll tell Wukong to smash your teeth in with his
gold−banded cudgel."
At the mention of a beating the idiot gesticulated frantically as he said, "The master's changed. Usually he
favours me and likes me and protects me because I'm so stupid. When you want to hit me, brother, he usually
persuades you not to. So why's he dead set on telling you to hit me today?"
"The master's angry with you for being so greedy," Monkey replied, "and holding us up on our journey. If you
don't want me to hit you, pack the luggage and get the horse ready."
As the idiot really was scared of being hit he jumped out of bed, got dressed and shouted to Friar Sand, "Get
up right now! He's going to start hitting." Friar Sand then jumped up too, and they both got everything packed.
"Keep quiet," said the Tang Priest, waving his hands about, "and don't disturb the monks." He quickly
mounted, after which they opened the gate of the monastery and found their way out. Indeed, this departure
was
Letting the phoenix escape from the birdcage of jade;
Secretly opening locks so the dragon goes free.
If you don't know what the households who still wanted to thank them did at daybreak, listen to the
explanation in the next installment.

The story tells how when Sanzang and his disciples were nowhere to be seen at dawn the monks in the Clouds
of Compassion Monastery all said, "We couldn't keep them, we couldn't say goodbye to them, and we weren't
able to ask them for anything. We've let those living Bodhisattvas slip clean away."
As they were talking, some of the great families from the Southern outskirts of the city came in with
invitations, at which the monks clapped their hands in regret and said, "We were caught off our guard last
night: they all rode off by cloud." Everyone then kowtowed to heaven in gratitude. The news was spread to all
the officials in the city, who told the great families to prepare the five kinds of sacrificial animal, flowers and
fruit to offer to the shrines in thanksgiving.
The story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples fed on the wind and slept in the open, travelling
uneventfully for the best part of a month. One day they suddenly saw a high mountain. "Disciples," said the
Tang Priest in fear, "the ridge in front of us is very steep. You must be very careful."
"As our journey has brought us so close to the land of the Buddha there will definitely be nothing evil here,"
said Monkey. "Don't worry, Master."
"Disciple," the Tang Priest replied, "although we are not far from the Buddha's land the monks told us in the
monastery the other and they didn't know how much further after that."
"Have you forgotten the Heart Sutra that the Rook's Nest Hermit taught you again, Master?" asked Monkey.
"The Prajna−paramita Heart Sutra is constantly with me, like my habit and begging bowl," Sanzang replied.
"There has not been a day ever since the Rook's Nest Hermit taught it to me that I have not recited it. I have
never forgotten it for a moment. I can even recite it backwards. How could I possibly forget it?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1293
"You can only recite it, Master," said Monkey. "You never asked the hermit to explain it."
"Ape!" retorted Sanzang. "How can you say I don't understand it? Do you understand it then?"
"Yes," Monkey replied, "I do."
After that neither Sanzang nor Monkey made another sound. This had Pig falling about with laughter, while
Friar Sand was hurting himself, he was so amused.
"Nonsense," said Pig. "We all started out in life as monsters. We're not Dhyana monks who've heard the sutras
being explained or Buddhist priests who've been taught the dharma. He's pretending, just putting on an act.
How can you say you understand? Well then, why aren't you saying anything? We're listening. Please
explain."
"Second brother," said Friar Sand, "leave him be. Big brother's only talking big like that to keep the master
going. What he knows about is how to use a cudgel. What does he know about explaining sutras?"
"Stop talking such nonsense, Wuneng and Wujing," said Sanzang. "Wukong understands the wordless
language. That is true explanation."
As master and disciples talked they did indeed cover a long distance, leaving the ridge behind them. They saw
a big monastery beside the road. "Wukong," said Sanzang. "There's a monastery ahead. Just look at it.
It's neither too big nor too small,
But has green glazed tiles;
Neither too new nor too old,
And with a red wall.
Leaning canopies of azure pines can just be seen:
Who knows how many thousand years old they are?
Listen to the murmur of the waters in the channel,
Cut from the mountain untold dynasties ago.
Above the gates is written,
'Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery';
The tablet is inscribed,
'Ancient relic.'"
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1294
Monkey saw that it was called the Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery, and Pig said so too. '"Spread Gold,'"
Sanzang wondered as he sat on his horse, "'Spread Gold' ...Can we be in the country of Sravasti?"
"This is very remarkable, Master," said Pig. "In all the years I've been with you you've never known the way
before, but you seem to know it now."
"No," Sanzang replied, "I have often read in the scriptures about the Buddha being in the Jetavana garden in
the city of Sravasti. The Venerable Almsgiver Sudatta tried to buy it from the prince as a place to ask the
Buddha to preach in. The prince refused to sell the garden, and said he would only part with it if it were
covered with gold. When the Venerable Almsgiver heard this he had gold bricks made with which he covered
the whole garden to buy it. Then he invited the Buddha to preach on the dharma. I am sure that the name
Spread Gold Monastery must refer to that story."
"We're in luck," said Pig with a smile, "If that story's true we can find ourselves one of those bricks as a
present to give people." Everybody laughed, after which Sanzang dismounted.
As they went in through the monastery gates they saw people carrying loads with shoulder−poles or on their
backs, pushing carts, or sitting in loaded carts. Others were sleeping or talking. The sight of the master, who
was so handsome, and his three hideous disciples rather frightened them, so they drew back to make way.
Worried that his disciples would provoke trouble, Sanzang kept saying, "Behave yourselves! Behave
yourselves!" They were all very restrained. As they went round the Vajra Hall a Dhyana monk of most
unworldly appearance came out to meet them:
A face like a shining full moon,
A body like a bodhi tree.
The wind blew through the sleeve round his staff,
As his sandals trod the stony path.
When Sanzang extended a monastic greeting to him the monk returned his courtesy and asked, "Where are
you from, teacher?"
"I am Chen Xuanzang," Sanzang replied, "sent to the Western Heaven at the command of the Great Tang
emperor in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. As my journey brings me here I am
paying you this hasty visit to request a night's shelter before continuing on my way tomorrow."
"This monastery of ours is one that receives people from all quarters," the monk replied. "Everyone is
welcome to visit, and we would be especially happy to provide for so holy a monk from the East as your
reverend self." Sanzang thanked him and called to his three disciples to come with him as they crossed the
cloister and refectory and went to the abbot's lodgings. When they had exchanged courtesies they sat down as
befits host and guests. Monkey and the other two sat down as well, their hands at their sides.
The story tells how, on learning that monks from Great Tang in the East who were going to fetch the
scriptures had arrived, all in the monastery, young and old alike, whether permanent inmates, itinerant monks,
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1295
elders or novices came to see them. After tea had been drunk a vegetarian meal was brought in. While
Sanzang was still saying the grace before the meal Pig in his impatience had already grabbed and wolfed
down steamed buns, vegetarian dishes and soup noodles. In the crowded abbot's lodgings those who knew
better were admiring Sanzang's majestic bearing, while those who enjoyed fun watched Pig eat.
When Friar Sand cast his eyes around and saw what was happening he gave Pig a discreet pinch and muttered,
"Behave yourself!"
At this Pig started a desperate howl of, "All this 'behave yourself, behave yourself!' I'm starving!"
"You don't understand, brother," Friar Sand replied with a smile. "When it comes to the belly, all the
well−behaved people in the world are exactly the same as we two." Only then did Pig stop eating. After
Sanzang had said the grace for the end of the meal the attendants cleared the tables and Sanzang expressed his
thanks.
When the monks asked about why they had come from the East, Sanzang's conversation turned to ancient
sites and he asked them about the name Spread Gold Monastery.
"This used to be the Monastery of the Venerable Almsgiver in the country of Sravasti," the monks answered.
"It was also known as the Jetavana and its name was changed to its present one after the Venerable Almsgiver
covered the ground with gold bricks, in those days the Venerable Almsgiver used to live in the country of
Sravasti, and our monastery was his Jetavana, which is why it was renamed the Almsgiver's Spread Gold
Monastery. The site of the Jetavana is at the back of the monastery. Whenever there has been a torrential
rainstorm in recent years, small pieces of gold and silver have been washed out, and some people are lucky
enough to pick them up."
"So the story is a true one," said Sanzang, going on to ask, "Why did I see so many travelling merchants with
horses, mules, carts and carrying−poles resting here when I came in through the gates of your monastery?"
"This mountain is called Mount Hundredfoot," the monks replied. "We used to live in peace and prosperity
here, but with the cyclic progression of the natural forces a number of centipede spirits have for some
inexplicable reason appeared. They attack people on the roads and though nobody gets killed people don't
dare to travel. At the foot of the mountain there's a Cock−crow Pass that people only dare to cross after
cock−crow. As all these strangers arrived late they are worried that it would not be safe and are putting up
here tonight. They'll set out at cock−crow." As master and disciples were talking a vegetarian meal was
brought in that they ate.
Sanzang and Monkey were strolling in the light of the rising half moon when a lay brother came to announce,
"Our ancient master would like to meet the gentlemen from China."
Sanzang at once turned to see an ancient monk holding a bamboo cane who came forward to greet him and
ask, "Are you the teacher come from China?"
"You do me too great an honour," Sanzang replied, returning his greeting. The old monk was full of
admiration for him, asking how old he was.
"I have wasted forty−five years," Sanzang replied. "May I ask how old you are?"
"Just one sixty−year cycle older than you, teacher," the other answered.
"Then you're a hundred and five this year," Brother Monkey said. "How old do you think I am?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1296
"Teacher," the old monk replied, "your appearance seems so ancient and your spirit so pure that I could not
tell in a hurry, especially by moonlight with my poor eyes." After talking for a while they walked to the back
cloister for a look round.
"Where is the site of the Almsgiver's Garden that you mentioned just now?" Sanzang asked.
"Outside the back gate," the other replied. On the order being given for the back gate to be opened
immediately, all that could be seen was the ruined base of a stone wall. Putting his hands together, Sanzang
sighed and said,
"I think of the benefactor Sudatta
Who gave his treasures to help the needy
The fame of Jetavana long endures;
Where is he now with the enlightened arhat?"
After a leisurely stroll enjoying the moonlight they sat down for a while on a terrace, where they heard the
sound of sobbing. As Sanzang listened with a still heart he could hear that the weeper was grieving because
her parents did not know of her suffering. This moved him to sorrow, and he found himself in tears as he
turned to the monks and asked, "Who is it being so sad, and where?" On hearing this question the ancient
monk sent all the others away to prepare tea, and when nobody else was around he kowtowed to the Tang
Priest and Brother Monkey.
"Venerable abbot," said Sanzang, helping him to his feet again, "why do you pay me this courtesy?"
"As I am over a hundred," the ancient monk replied, "I do know a little of the ways of the world; and in
between periods of meditation and stillness I have seen some things. I know a certain amount about you, my
lord, and your disciples, and you are not like other people. The only teachers here who would be able to
analyze this most painful business are you."
"Tell me what it's all about," said Monkey.
"A year ago today," the ancient monk replied, "I was concentrating my mind on the nature of the moon when I
suddenly heard a gust of wind and the sound of someone grieving. I got out of bed, went into the Jetavana and
saw a beautiful girl there. 'Whose daughter are you?' I asked her. 'Why are you here?' 'I am a princess, the
daughter of the king of India,' the girl replied. 'The wind blew me here when I was looking at the flowers by
moonlight.' I locked her up in an empty room that I bricked up like a prison cell, just leaving a gap in the door
big enough to pass a bowl through. That day I told the other monks that she was an evil spirit I had captured.
But as we monks are compassionate I couldn't kill her, and every day she is given two meals of simple food
and drink to keep her alive. The girl is clever enough to understand what I mean, and to prevent herself from
being sullied by the other monks she has pretended to be deranged and slept in her own piss and shit. During
the day she talks nonsense or just sits there in silence, but in the still of the night she cries because she misses
her parents. I've been into the city several times to make enquiries about the princesses, but not a single one is
missing. So I have put her under stronger locks, and I am even more determined not to let her go. Now that
you have come here, teacher, I beg you to go to the capital and use your dharma powers to find out the truth.
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1297
You will thus be able both to rescue the good and display your magical powers."
When Sanzang and Monkey heard this they noted it very carefully. As they were talking two junior monks
came in to invite them to take tea and go to bed, so they went back inside.
Back in the abbot's lodgings Pig and Friar Sand were grumbling, "We'll have to be on our way at cock−crow
tomorrow, so why aren't you in bed yet?"
"What's that you're saying, idiot?" Monkey asked.
"Go to bed," Pig replied. "Why are you admiring the blooming scenery this late?" At this the ancient monk
left them, and the Tang Priest went to bed.
Sweet dreams of flowers in the moonlit silence;
Warm breezes coming through the window gauze.
As water drips in the clepsydra to fill three sections,
The Milky Way shines on the splendors of the palace.
They had not slept long that night when they heard the cocks crowing. The traders in front of the monastery
all got up noisily and prepared their breakfast by lamplight. The venerable elder woke up Pig and Friar Sand
to bridle the horse and pack up, while Monkey called for lamps to be lit. The monks of the monastery, who
were up already, set out tea, soup and snacks, and waited on them. Pig ate a plate of steamed buns with delight
then took the luggage and the horse outside while Sanzang and Brother Monkey took their leave of all the
monks.
"Please don't forget about that very tragic business," said the ancient monk.
"I'll give it all my attention," Monkey replied, "all my attention. Once I'm in the city I'll be able to find out the
truth from what I hear and see." They traders noisily set off together. By the last watch of the night they were
through Cockcrow Pass, and by ten in the morning the walls of the city were in sight. It was indeed a powerful
city as strong as an iron cauldron, the heavenly capital of a divine region. The city
Was a crouching tiger or a coiled dragon on high ground,
Colorful with its phoenix towers and unicorn halls.
The waters of the royal moat encircled it like a belt;
In his mountainside paradise were many a monument.
The morning sun lit up banners by the high−way;
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1298
The spring wind carried the sound of pipes and drums across the bridges.
The wise king was dressed in robes and crown,
The crops were abundant and the splendor manifest.
That day they reached the streets of the Eastern market, where the traders all put up at inns. As Sanzang and
his disciples were walking in the city they came to a government hostel and went inside. The hostel manager
went to report to the hostel superintendent that there were four strange−looking monks outside who had
arrived with a white horse. On being told about the horse the superintendent realized that they must be on an
official mission, so he went out to welcome them.
"I have been sent by the Tang court in the East to the Great Thunder Monastery on Vulture Peak to see the
Buddha and seek the scriptures," Sanzang replied with a bow. "I have a passport to present at court for
inspection. I would be grateful if I could spend the night in Your Excellency's distinguished hostel. I will be
on my way when my business has been done."
"This hostel has been established to entertain envoys and travelers," the superintendent replied, returning his
bow, "so it is only right that we should entertain you. Please come in, please come in."
A delighted Sanzang invited his disciples to come in to meet the superintendent, who was quietly appalled by
their hideous faces. He did not know whether they were men or demons, so he trembled as he saw to tea and a
vegetarian meal for them. Noticing his fright, Sanzang said, "Don't be afraid, Your Excellency. My three
disciples look hideous, but they are good at heart. As the saying goes, the faces are ugly but the men are kind.
There's nothing to be afraid of about them."
The hostel superintendent's worries were eased when he heard this. "Where is your Tang court, Teacher of the
Nation?"
"In the land of China in the continent of Jambu," Sanzang replied.
"When did you leave home?" was the next question.
"In the thirteenth year of Zhenguan, fourteen years ago," Sanzang replied. "I had to cross thousands of rivers
and mountains−−it was very hard−−to arrive here."
"You are a holy monk," the hostel superintendent said.
"How old is your exalted dynasty?" Sanzang asked.
"This is the great land of India," the superintendent replied, "and the dynasty has endured for over five
hundred years since our High Ancestor. Our reigning sovereign, who is a lover of landscapes and flowers, is
known as the Happy Emperor. His reign−period is called Jingyan and is now in its twenty−eighth year."
"I would like to have an audience with His Majesty today to have the passport inspected and returned," said
Sanzang. "When does he hold court?"
"Splendid," the superintendent said, "absolutely splendid. Today is the twentieth birthday of Her Royal
Highness, the king's daughter. A decorated tower has been built at the crossroads, where the princess is going
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1299
to throw down an embroidered ball to let heaven decide who her husband it to be. Today is a very lively one,
and I believe that His Majesty will not yet have finished his morning audience. This would be a good time to
go if you wish to have your passport inspected and returned." Sanzang was just about to set happily off when
the meal was brought in, so he ate it with the superintendent, Monkey and the other two.
By now it was past midday, and Sanzang said, "I had better be going."
"I'll escort you, Master," said Brother Monkey. "Me too," said Pig.
"No, don't, brother," put in Friar Sand. "Your face is nothing much to look at, so there's no point in your going
to look impressive outside the palace gates. Best let our big brother go,"
"Wujing is right," Sanzang commented. "The idiot is coarse and stupid. Wukong is more clever and subtle."
The idiot thrust his snout out and said, "Apart from you, Master, there's not much to choose between our three
faces."
Sanzang then put on his cassock. Monkey took the passport case had accompanied him. In the streets
everyone−−gentleman, peasant; artisan, trader, scholar, pen−pusher, dim−wit, or common man−−was
exclaiming, "Let's go and see the embroidered ball being thrown."
Sanzang stood beside the road and said to Monkey, "People, clothes, buildings, language and speech here are
all the same as in our Great Tang. I remember that my late mother married after throwing an embroidered ball
to make the match she was destined for, and they have that custom here too."
"What about us going to take a look too?" asked Monkey.
"No, no," Sanzang replied. "We are not wearing the right clothes for the occasion. We might arouse
suspicion."
"Master," said Monkey, "you've forgotten what the ancient monk in the Spread Gold Monastery told us. We
could find out whether she is genuine or not while we're taking a good look at the decorated tower. With all
this bustle and activity the king is bound to be going to hear the princess's good news. He won't bother with
court business. Let's go." On hearing this Sanzang did indeed go with Monkey. All kinds of people were there
to watch the throwing of the embroidered ball. Oh dear! Little did they know that by going they were like a
fisherman casting his hook and line and catching himself trouble.
The story now explains that two years earlier the king of India had taken his queen, consorts and daughter into
the royal garden to enjoy a moonlit night because he so loved landscapes and flowers. This had provoked an
evil spirit, who had carried the princess off and turned herself into the girl's double. When she learned that the
Tang Priest was coming at this time, day, month and year the evil spirit had used the wealth of the kingdom to
build the decorated tower in the hope of winning him as her mate and absorbing his true masculine primal
essence to make herself a superior immortal of the Great Monad.
At the third mark of the noonday hour, when Sanzang and Monkey had joined in the crowd and were
approaching the tower, the princess lit some incense and prayed to heaven and earth. She was surrounded by
five or six dozen exquisitely made−up beauties who were attending her and holding her embroidered ball for
her. The tower had many windows on all sides. As the princess looked around she saw the Tang Priest
approaching, so she took the embroidered ball and threw it with her own hands at the Tang Priest's head. It
knocked his Vairocana mitre askew, giving him such a start that he immediately reached with both hands to
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1300
steady the ball, which rolled down his sleeve.
At once there were great shouts from everyone on the tower of, "She's hit a monk! She's hit a monk!"
Oh dear! All the travelling merchants at the crossroads pushed and shouted as they rushed to grab the
embroidered ball, to be met by Monkey with a shout and bared teeth as he bent forward then grew to the
majestic height of thirty feet. The hideous face he made gave them all such a fright that they collapsed and
crawled about, not daring to come closer. A moment later they had all scattered and Monkey resumed his true
form.
The maids, palace beauties and senior and junior eunuchs who had been in the tower all camp up to the Tang
Priest, kowtowed to him and said, "Your Highness, we beg you to come to the palace to be congratulated."
Sanzang was quick to return their greetings and help them all back to their feet.
He then turned back to grumble at Monkey, "Ape! You've been trying to make a fool of me again."
"It was your head the embroidered ball landed on," Monkey replied with a laugh, "and your sleeve it rolled
into. Nothing to do with me, so what are you moaning at me for?"
"What are we going to do?" Sanzang asked.
"Stop worrying, Master," Monkey said. "While you go to the palace to see the king I'll go back to the hostel to
tell Pig and Friar Sand to wait. If the princess doesn't want you, that'll be that. You submit the passport and we
can be on our way. If the princess insists on marriage you must say to the king, 'Please send for my disciples
so that I can take my leave of them.' When we three are summoned to court I'll be able to tell whether the
princess is real or an impostor. This is the trick called 'subduing a demon through marriage.'" The Tang Priest
had nothing to say as Monkey turned away and went back to the hostel.
The venerable elder was hustled by the palace beauties and the rest of them to the foot of the tower, from
where the princess came down to support him with her jade hand as they both entered the royal carriage. The
retinue formed a procession to return to the palace gates.
The eunuch gate−officer at once reported to the king, "Your Majesty, Her Royal Highness the princess is
outside the Meridional Gate, holding a monk's arm and waiting to be summoned. I expect she hit him with her
embroidered ball."
The king was most displeased to hear this, and wanted to have the monk driven away, but as he did not know
what the princess had in mind he restrained his feelings and summoned them in. The princess and the Tang
Priest came in to stand beneath the throne hall. Indeed:
Man and future wife both hailed the king aloud;
Good and ill together with deep respect kowtowed.
When this ceremonial had been performed they were called into the throne hall, where the king began by
asking, "Where are you from, monk? Did our daughter hit you with her ball?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1301
The Tang Priest prostrated himself to reply, "I have been sent by the emperor of Great Tang in the continent
of Jambu to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Great Thunder
Monastery. As I carry a passport for this long journey I was coming to present it for inspection at Your
Majesty's dawn audience when I passed a decorated tower at a crossroads, never imagining that Her Royal
Highness the princess would throw an embroidered ball that would hit me on the head. As I am a monk and
belong to a different faith I could not possibly marry your exquisite daughter, so I beg you to spare me the
death penalty and return the passport. Then I can be on my way and soon reach Vulture Peak, see the Buddha,
ask for the scriptures and return to my own country, where Your Majesty's divine mercy will be for ever
recorded."
"So you are a holy monk from the East," the king replied. "Indeed, 'a thread can draw together a fated match
across a thousand miles.' Our princess has reached the age of nineteen and is still unmarried, and as the hour,
day, month and year are all now auspicious a decorated tower was set up for her to choose a good husband by
throwing the ball from it. You just happened to be hit by it, and although this does not please us we would like
to know the princess's views."
"Your Majesty my father," the princess replied, kowtowing, "as the saying goes, 'Marry a cockerel and follow
a cockerel; marry a dog and follow a dog.' I swore a vow beforehand, made the ball and told heaven, earth and
the gods that heaven would choose as my husband the man my ball hit. As the ball hit the holy monk today
this must have been fated ever since an earlier incarnation, which is why we met today. I would never dare to
change my mind. I ask you to take him as your son−in−law."
Only then was the king happy, and he commanded the chief royal astrologer to choose a day. While
organizing the trousseau the king issued proclamations to the world. When Sanzang heard this, so far from
thanking the king for his kindness, he pleaded, "Forgive me, forgive me."
"You're most unreasonable, monk," the king replied. "We offer you a nation's wealth to be our son−in−law.
Why won't you stay here and enjoy yourself? All you can think about is fetching the scriptures. If you go on
refusing we will have the palace guards take you out and behead you."
The venerable elder was so frightened by this that his soul left his body as he kowtowed, trembling, and
submitted, "I am grateful for Your Majesty's heavenly grace, but there are four of us monks travelling West. I
have three disciples outside. If I am now to be taken as your son−in−law I beg you to summon them inside as
I have not yet taken my leave of them. Then you can return the passport and let them go at once, so that they
will not fail in the purpose of their journey to the West."
The king approved this request, asking, "Where are your disciples?"
"In the government hostel for foreigners," Sanzang replied, and officers were at once sent to fetch the holy
monk's disciples to receive the passport and be on their way, leaving the holy monk there to be the princess's
husband. The venerable elder could only rise to his feet and stand in attendance.
For the Great Elixir not to leak away the Triple Completeness is needed;
Blame an evil fate if the ascetic way is hard.
The Way is in the sage traditions; cultivation depends on the self;
Goodness is accumulated by people, but blessings come from Heaven.
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1302
Do not give play to the six sense−organs and their many desires;
Open up the single nature, original and primary.
When there are no attachments or thoughts, purity comes of itself;
Strive for liberation and achieve transcendence.
We will say no more of how officers were sent to the hostel to fetch Sanzang's three disciples.
Instead the story tells how Monkey, after taking his leave of Sanzang at the foot of the decorated tower, went
happily back to the hostel, laughing aloud as he walked. "Why are you laughing so cheerfully, brother," Pig
and Friar Sand asked as they greeted him, "and why's the master disappeared?"
"The master has found happiness," Monkey replied. "What happiness?" Pig asked. "He hasn't reached the end
of the journey, he hasn't seen the Buddha and he hasn't fetched the scriptures."
"The master and I only got as far as the foot of a decorated tower at the crossroads," Brother Monkey replied.
"Just then the king's daughter hit the master with an embroidered ball, so he was hustled by palace beauties,
pretty girls and eunuchs to the front of the tower, where he climbed into a carriage to go to the palace with the
princess. He's been invited to become the king's son−in−law. Isn't that something to be cheerful about?"
When Pig heard this he stamped, beat his chest and said, "If I'd known beforehand, I'd have gone too. It was
all Friar Sand's fault for making trouble. I'd have run straight to the foot of the decorated tower, the
embroidered ball would have hit me first time, and the princess would have taken me for her husband. That
would have been marvellous, terrific. I'm handsome and good−looking: I'd have been just the man. We'd all
have been in luck and have had a good time. It'd have been real fun."
Friar Sand went up to Pig, rubbed his face and said, "Shameless, you're shameless! That's a handsome mug, I
must say. You're like the man who bought an old donkey for three−tenths of an ounce of silver and boasted
that he'd be able to ride it. If she'd hit you first time she wouldn't have wanted to wait till tonight before
burning spells to get rid of you. Do you think she'd have let trouble like you into the palace?"
"You're being very disagreeable, you blacky," Pig replied. "Ugly I may be, but I've got class. As the old
saying goes, 'When skin and flesh are coarse, the bones may yet be strong: everyone is good at something.'"
"Stop talking nonsense, idiot," Monkey retorted, "and pack the baggage. I expect the master will get anxious
and send for us, so we must be ready to go to protect him at court."
"You're wrong again, brother," said Pig. "If the master's become the king's son−in−law and gone to take his
pleasure with the king's daughter, he won't be climbing any more mountains, or tramping along the road, or
running into demons and monsters. So what'll he want you to protect him from? He's old enough to know
what happens under the bedcovers. He won't need you to hold him up."
Monkey grabbed Pig by the ear, swung his fist, and said abusively, "You're as dirty−minded as ever, you
cretin! How dare you talk such nonsense!"
While they were in the middle of their quarrel the hostel superintendent came to report, "His Majesty has sent
an official here with a request for you three holy monks to present yourselves."
Journey to the West
Chapter 93 1303
"What's he really asking us to go for?"
"The senior holy monk had the good fortune to be hit by the princess's golden ball and be taken as her
husband," the superintendent replied, "which is why the official has come with invitations for you."
"Where is the official?" Monkey asked. "Send him in."
The official then bowed in greeting to Monkey, after which he did not dare look straight at Monkey as he
muttered to himself, "Is it a ghost? a monster? a thunder god? a yaksha?"
"Why are you mumbling instead of saying whatever you have to say, official?" Monkey asked.
Trembling with terror, the official raised the royal edict with both hands as his words came tumbling out in
confusion: "Her Royal Highness−−invitation−−meet her new relations−−Her Royal Highness−−meet her
relations−−invitation...."
"We've got no torture equipment here and we're not going to beat you," Pig said, "so don't be frightened and
take your time telling us."
"Do you think he's scared you're going to beat him?" Monkey said. "What he's scared of is your ugly mug. Get
the carrying−pole load packed up at once. We're taking the horse and going to court to see the master and talk
things over." Indeed:
One you meet on a narrow path is hard to avoid;
Determination can turn love to hatred.
If you do not know what was said when they met the king, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 94
The Four Monks Dine to Music in the Palace Gardens
One Demon Loves in Vain and Longs for Bliss
The story tells how Brother Monkey and the other two disciples went with the official who had brought the
invitation to outside the Meridional Gate of the palace, where the eunuch gate officer immediately reported
their arrival and brought back a summons for them to enter. The three of them stood in a row, not bowing.
"Are you three gentlemen the illustrious disciples of the holy monk? What are your names? Where do you
live? Why did you become monks? What scriptures are you going to fetch?" Monkey then came closer,
intending to enter the throne hall.
"Don't move," one of the king's bodyguards shouted. "If you have anything to say, say it standing down
there."
"We monks like to step forward whenever we're given an opening," Monkey said with a smile, at which Pig
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1304
and Friar Sand too approached the king. Worried that their rough manners would alarm the king, Sanzang
stepped forward and called out, "Disciples, His Majesty has asked you why you have come here. You must
submit your reply."
Seeing his master standing in attendance beside the king, Monkey could not restrain himself from calling
aloud, "Your Majesty is treating yourself with respect but others with contempt. If you are taking my master
as your son−in−law, why do you make him stand in attendance on you? The normal custom is for a king to
call his son−in−law Your Excellency, and an Excellency really ought to be sitting down."
This gave the king so bad a fright that he turned pale and wished he could leave the throne hall. But as this
would have looked very bad he had to summon up his courage and tell his attendants of fetch an embroidered
stool on which he invited the Tang Priest to sit. Only then did Brother Monkey submit the following spoken
memorial: "My ancestral home is the Water Curtain Cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of
Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body.
My father was heaven, my mother earth,
And I was born when a rock split open.
1 took as my master a Taoist adept,
And mastered the Great Way.
Then I returned to my land of immortals,
Where I gathered all of us to live in our cave heaven.
In the ocean's depths I subdued the dragons,
Then climbed the mountains to capture wild beasts.
I removed us from the registers of death,
Put us on the rolls of the living,
And was appointed Great Sage Equaling Heaven.
I enjoyed the heavenly palaces,
And roamed around the splendid buildings.
I met the immortals of Heaven
In daily carousals;
Lived in the holy regions,
Happy every day.
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1305
But because I disrupted the Peach Banquet,
And raised a rebellion in the palaces of Heaven,
I was captured by the Lord Buddha
And imprisoned under the Five Elements Mountain.
When hungry I was fed on pellets of iron,
When thirsty I drank molten copper:
For five hundred years I tasted no food or tea.
Fortunately my master came from the East
To worship in the West.
Guanyin told him to deliver me from heavenly disaster.
I was rescued from my torment
To be converted to the Yogacarin sect.
My old name was Wukong;
Now I am known as the Novice."
When the king realized how important Monkey was he quickly came down from his dragon throne and
walked over to steady the venerable elder with his hand and say, "Son−in−law, it was divine providence that
brought us one such as yourself to be our kinsman through marriage." Sanzang thanked the king profoundly
for his graciousness and urged him to return to his throne. "Which gentleman has the distinction of being the
second disciple?" the king asked. Pig thrust his snout out to make himself look more impressive as he replied:
"In previous lives old Pig used to be
Given to pleasure and indolence.
I lived in confusion,
My nature disordered and my heart deluded.
1 did not know how high the sky was or how deep the earth;
I could not tell the ocean's width or the mountains' distance.
Then in the middle of my idleness
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1306
I suddenly met a true immortal.
In half a sentence
He undid the net of evil;
With two or three remarks
He smashed the gate to disaster.
Then I became aware,
Took him as my master on the spot,
Diligently studied the arts of the Double Eight,
Respectfully refined the Triple Three's sequence.
When training was complete I was able to fly,
And ascend to the heavenly palace.
The Jade Emperor in his benevolence
Appointed me as Marshal Tian Peng,
To command the marines of the River of Heaven,
And wander at ease within the palace gates.
Then when I was drunk at the Peach Banquet
I misbehaved with the goddess of the moon,
Was stripped of my commission,
And exiled to the mortal world.
Because I came into the wrong womb
1 was born with the likeness of a pig.
Living at the Mount of Blessing
I committed unbounded evil.
When I met the Bodhisattva Guanyin
She showed me the way of goodness.
I came over to the Buddhist faith
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1307
To escort the Tang Priest
On his journey to the Western Heaven,
Seeking the marvellous scriptures.
My Dharma name is Wuneng,
And people call me Bajie."
When the king heard this he trembled with fear, not daring to look at him. This made the idiot more spirited
than ever, shaking his head, pursing his lips, thrusting his ears up and roaring with laughter.
Sanzang, worried that Pig was giving the king a fright, shouted, "Control yourself, Bajie." Only then did Pig
put his hands together and pretend to behave himself.
"And why was the third distinguished disciple converted?" the king then asked. Putting his hands together,
Friar Sand said:
"I was originally a mortal man,
Who turned to the Way out of fear of the Wheel of Reincarnation.
1 wandered like a cloud to the corners of the seas.
Roamed to the very ends of the sky.
I always wore the robe and held the begging−bowl,
And ever concentrated my mind within the body.
Because of my sincerity
I fell in with immortals,
Raised the Baby Boy,
To mate him with the Lovely Girl.
When the Three Thousand Tasks were achieved
All was combined in the Four Images.
I rose above the boundary of the sky,
Bowed to the dark vault of heaven,
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1308
And was appointed Curtain−lifting General.
1 was in attendance on the Phoenix and Dragon Carriage,
And General was my rank.
Because at the Peach Banquet
1 accidentally smashed a crystal bowl
1 was exiled to the Flowing Sands River,
My face was altered,
And I became an evil killer.
Fortunately the Bodhisattva traveled to the East
To persuade me to turn to the faith
And await the Buddha's son from Tang.
Who would go to seek scriptures in the Western Heaven.
I became his follower and made a fresh start,
Refining once more my great awareness.
I took my surname Sand from the river;
My Buddhist name is Wujing,
And my title Friar."
The king was both most alarmed and most delighted to hear this. Delighted because his daughter had found
herself a living Buddha, and alarmed by three veritable evil gods. Just as the king was being torn between
alarm and delight the chief astrologer submitted this memorial: "The wedding has been set for the twelfth day
of this month, the day of water−rat, a lucky time at which all will be auspicious for nuptials."
"What day is it today?" the king asked.
"Today is the eighth, the day of earth−monkey," the astrologer replied, "the day on which gibbons offer fruit,
and the right day on which to advance worthies and accept their suggestions." This greatly pleased the king,
who sent his officials in attendance to have the halls and pavilions in the royal garden swept clear. Here he
invited his future son−in−law with his three distinguished disciples to stay while they waited for the nuptial
feast at which the princess would marry him. The underlings all carried out their instructions, the king ended
the audience and the officials withdrew.
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1309
The story now tells how when Sanzang and his disciples reached the imperial garden night was falling. A
vegetarian meal was laid on. "We really deserve a meal today," said Pig with delight. The people in charge
brought in plain rice and pasta by the carrying−pole load. Pig kept eating a bowlful then taking a refill over
and over again. He only stopped eating when his stomach was completely full. A little later the lamps were lit
and the bedding laid out, after which everyone went to bed. As soon as the venerable elder saw that there was
nobody around he started to shout angrily at Monkey, berating him.
"You macaque, Wukong! You keep ruining me. I said we were just going to present the passport and told you
not to go near the decorated tower. Why did you keep demanding to take me there to have a look? Well, did
you have a good enough look? Whatever are we to do about this trouble you have got us into?"
"Master," replied Monkey, putting on a smile, "it was you who said, 'My late mother married after throwing
an embroidered ball to make the match she was destined for.' I only took you there because you seemed to
want to enjoy something of the past. Besides, because I remembered what the ancient monk in the Almsgiver's
Spread Gold Monastery said I came here to find out whether she's an impostor or not. When I saw the king
just now there was something a bit sinister about the way he looked, but I haven't yet seen what the princess is
like."
"What will happen when you see the princess?" the venerable elder asked.
"My fiery eyes with their golden pupils can tell whether someone's true or false, good or evil, rich or poor,"
Monkey replied. "I'll know what to do and be able to sort out right and wrong."
"So you've learned physiognomy in the last few days, elder brother," said Friar Sand and Pig with a smile.
"Physiognomists are just my grandson," Brother Monkey replied.
"Stop joking," shouted Sanzang. "He definitely wants me now. What are we to do about it?"
"At that happy occasion on the twelfth the princess is bound to come out to pay her respects to her parents,"
said Monkey. "I'll take a look at her from where I'll stand by the side. If she really is a woman you can be her
consort and enjoy the kingdom's glory and splendor." This made Sanzang angrier than ever.
"You're a fine ape," he said abusively, "still trying to ruin me. As Wuneng said, we have already done
ninety−seven or ninety−eight hundredths of the journey. You're trying to destroy me with your crafty tongue
again. Shut up! Don't open that stinking mouth of yours any more. Next time there's any misbehavior from
you I shall start reciting that spell again, and that will be more than you can take."
The mention of the spell being recited had Monkey falling straight to his knees before Sanzang and pleading,
"Don't say it, don't say it! If she's really a woman we'll all raise a rumpus in the palace during the wedding
ceremony and get you out." While master and disciples were talking they had not noticed that it was now
night. Indeed:
Slow dripped the clepsydras;
Heavy hung the fragrance of the flowers.
Pearl curtains hung over splendid doorways;
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1310
No fire or light was seen in the still courtyard.
Empty was the shadow of the deserted swing;
All was silence when the flute's notes died away.
The room was surrounded by flowers and bright in the moonbeams,
Lit by those spiky stars not blocked by any trees.
The cuckoo rested from her song;
Long was the butterfly's dream.
The River Way spanned the celestial vault
While white clouds made their way home.
Just when they were closest in feeling
The willows swaying in the wind were more dispiriting than ever.
"It's late, Master," said Pig. "Let's carry on arguing tomorrow morning. Go to sleep now, go to sleep!" Master
and disciples did then get a night's sleep.
The golden cockerel was soon greeting the dawn, and the king entered the throne hall for his audience. This is
what could be seen:
A purple aura rising high above the opened palace
As the winds carried royal music to the azure sky.
While clouds drifted, the leopard−tail banners moved;
The sun shone upon the demon figures on the roof, and the jade pendants tinkled.
A scented mist delicately touched the palace's green willows,
While dewdrops lightly moistened the garden flowers.
A thousand officials in ranks shouted and danced in homage:
Seas and rivers were at peace and the state was unified.
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1311
When all the civil and military officials had paid their homage to him, the king proclaimed, "The Department
of Foreign Relations will arrange a nuptial banquet for the twelfth. Today the spring wine shall be prepared,
and our future son−in−law shall be entertained in the royal gardens." The Protocol Office were told to lead the
three worthy future royal in−laws to sit in the state hostel while the Department of Foreign Relations laid on a
vegetarian banquet for the three of them. The two departments arranged for the musicians of the court
orchestra to play and look after them while they passed the days enjoying the beauty of spring.
As soon as Pig heard this he said, "Your Majesty, we always stay with our master: we never leave him for a
moment. As he's going to be drinking and feasting in the palace gardens we'd better go along for a couple of
days' fun too if our master's to be your son−in−law. Otherwise the deal's off." Seeing how ugly and
coarse−spoken Pig was, twisting his head and neck, thrusting his snout out and waving his ears−−which all
made him seem rather intimidating−−the king was so worried that Pig might ruin the wedding that he had to
accede to the request.
"Prepare a banquet for two in the Sino−Barbarian Hall of Eternal Pacification for our son−in−law and ourself.
Prepare a meal for the other three gentlemen in the Pavilion of Lingering Spring. We are afraid that it might
be inconvenient for master and disciples to sit together." Only then did the idiot chant his respects to the king
and thank him. Everyone then withdrew, after which the king ordered the officials of the inner palace to
prepare a banquet, and told the queens and consorts of the three palaces and six compounds to give the
princess hair ornaments, cakes and other things for the wedding on the twelfth.
It was now about ten in the morning, and the king had a carriage ready in which to take the Tang Priest and
the others to go to see the palace gardens. The gardens were a fine place:
The paths, inlaid with coloured stones,
Have carved and chiseled balustrades.
Beside the paths inlaid with coloured stones
Strange flowers spread over the rocks;
Outside the carved and chiseled balustrades,
And within them too, flower blossoms rare.
Early peach trees are a bewitching turquoise,
And golden orioles dart among the willows.
The walker finds the fragrance fill his sleeve,
And many pure scents imbue his clothing.
Phoenix terrace and dragon pool,
Bamboo lodge and pine pavilion.
On the phoenix terrace
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1312
Pipes are played to lure the phoenix to appear;
In the dragon pools
Fish are reared to become dragons and leave.
In the bamboo lodge are poems
Whose well−chosen words match the "White Snow Melody"
The books in the pine pavilion
Are pearls and jade in blue−covered volumes.
Rocks and jade twist around the artificial hills;
Deep are the blue−green waters of the winding stream.
Peony pavilions,
Rose bowers,
Make a natural brocade.
Trellises of jasmine,
Beds of begonia,
Are like sunset clouds or jeweled mosaics.
Herbaceous peonies are marvelously fragrant;
Rare is the beauty of the mallows from Sichuan.
White pear and red apricot blossom vie in scent;
Purple orchid and golden daylily compete in splendor.
Corn poppy,
Lily magnolia buds,
Azalea flowers,
Are brilliantly coloured.
Magnolia flowers,
Garden balsam,
Plantain lilies,
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1313
Tremble.
Everywhere red shines through the richness of cosmetics
While heavy scents drift from a brocade surrounding screen.
The warmth returning with the East wind is greeted with joy;
All the garden's beauties display their brilliance.
The king and his companions walked around enjoying the flowers for a long time. Soon the officials of the
Protocol Office came to invite Monkey and the other two to the Pavilion of Lingering Spring while the king
led the Tang Priest by the hand to the Sino−Barbarian Hall so that they could all drink and feast. These were
splendid occasions with singing, dancing and instrumental music. Indeed:
The sun shone from the majestic palace gates;
Good auras filled the royal buildings.
The spring spread out an embroidery of flowers,
And heaven's light shone from afar on the court robes.
Pipes and singers wafted their music as if in a banquet of immortals;
The goblets flew, carrying jade liquor.
Master and subjects enjoyed the same pleasure
As Sino−barbarian peace brought prosperity.
Seeing with what great respect he was being treated by the king, the venerable elder had nothing for it but to
force himself to join in the celebrations. In fact he gave only a show of happiness: inside he was miserable. As
he sat there he saw four golden screens hanging on the wall, screens painted with scenes of the four seasons.
Each picture had a poem on it by a famous academician. The poem on the spring scene read:
The vital forces of heaven turn creation around;
The world is happy and everything is renewed.
The peach and the plum blossoms vie in splendor;
Swallows fly to the painted rafters, shaking the incense dust.
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1314
The poem on the summer scene read:
In warm and sultry air all thoughts are slow
The palace mallow and pomegranate reflect the sun's brilliance.
The jade flute's music disturbs the noonday dream;
The scent of caltrops is wafted through the curtains.
The poem on the autumn scene read:
One leaf on the parasol tree by the well is yellow;
The pearl curtain is not rolled up on the night of frost.
After the autumn sacrifice the swallows abandon their nest;
When the rush flowers snap, the wild geese leave for another land.
The poem on the winter scene read:
The clouds fly over the rainy sky, all dark and cold;
The North wind blows the snow into thousands of bills.
Deep in the palace the stove glows warm;
They say the plum has blossomed by the jade balustrade.
When the king noticed the absorption with which the Tang Priest was gazing at the poems he said, "As you
enjoy savoring the poems so much you must be a fine poet yourself, son−in−law. If you do not begrudge your
pearls we would like to invite you to make up a matching poem for each of them, ending three of the lines
with the same word. Will you agree?"
The venerable elder was the sort of person who could be so carried away by a scene that he forgot the
circumstances, someone who had an enlightened mind and thoroughly comprehended his own nature, so when
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1315
the king pressed him so earnestly to match the verses he found himself saying the line, "The sun's warmth
melts the ice the world around."
This greatly pleased the king, who told the officials in attendance on him, "Fetch the four treasures of the
study, so that our son−in−law can write down the matching verses he composes for us to savor at our leisure."
The venerable elder was glad to comply. Picking up a brush, he produced matching lines. The matching poem
on the spring scene read:
The sun's warmth melts the ice the world around;
Within the palace garden, flowers are renewed.
Gentle winds and rain enrich the people;
Rivers and seas are calm; gone is all worldly dust.
The matching poem on the summer scene read:
The Dipper now points South; the day goes slow;
Locust and pomegranate trees contend in brilliance.
Golden oriole and purple swallow sing in the willows,
Their melodious voices drifting through red curtains.
The matching poem on the autumn read:
Fragrant the green mandarin; the orange turns to yellow.
Blue pine and cypress welcome frost's coming.
Half−open chrysanthemums make a tapestry on the trellis;
Pipes and songs waft through the watery, cloud−covered land.
The matching poem on the winter scene read:
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1316
As skies clear after welcome snow the air is cold;
Grotesque−shaped crags and boulders mark jade hills.
As charcoal burns in the stove to warm the yogurt
Singing with hands in their sleeves they lean on jade balustrades.
The king was utterly delighted by the matching verses. "'Singing with hands in their sleeves they lean on jade
balustrades' is really good," he said with admiration, and ordered the royal orchestra to set the new poems to
music. The banquet did not break up until the day was over.
Brother Monkey and the other two were also having a splendid meal in the Pavilion of Lingering Spring. Each
of them was feeling rather merry after downing a few cups, and they decided to go to see their master, who
was in another building with the king. This made Pig start acting like the idiot he was.
"This is great," he yelled at once. "We're doing very nicely here. Today we've had a right good time. But now
we're full we ought to go to sleep it off."
"You really are ill−bred, brother," said Friar Sand with a grin. "How could you possibly go to sleep when
you're as full as that?"
"You wouldn't know," said Pig. "There's a saying that goes,
Unless you stretch out for a nap when you've dined
How can your belly with fat be well lined?"
When the Tang Priest had taken his leave of the king he went back to the pavilion and scolded pig: "Cretin!
You acted coarser than ever. What sort of place do you think this is, to shout and yell like that? If you had
made the king angry he would have had you killed."
"Don't worry," Pig replied, "don't worry. We're being treated as his in−laws, so it would be very awkward for
him to get angry with us. As the proverb goes,
If you're related a beating can't rend it;
If you are neighbors a cursing won't end it.
We were only joking. He's nothing to be frightened of."
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1317
At this the venerable elder shouted, "Bring the idiot here. Give him twenty strokes of the dhyana staff."
Monkey then grabbed Pig and knocked him over, while Sanzang raised the cudgel to beat him.
"Master, Royal Son−in−law," the idiot shouted, "Spare me! Spare me!"
One of the officials who was present at the banquet persuaded Sanzang not to hit Pig, who clambered back on
his feet, grumbling, "You're a fine excellency; you're a fine royal son−in−law. Applying the royal law before
you're even married!"
"Stop that nonsense," said Monkey, making a face at him, "stop that nonsense! Go to bed at once." They then
spent another night in the Lingering Spring Pavilion. The next morning they feasted as before.
Before long they had been enjoying themselves for three or four days, by when it was that splendid day, the
twelfth. The officials of the three sections of the Department of Foreign Relations all submitted a memorial
that said, "Since we received the edicts on the eighth the palace for the Royal Son−in−law has been built, and
all that we are waiting for is for the trousseau to be installed. The nuptial banquet has been prepared, with
meat and vegetarian food for over five hundred guests."
This greatly pleased the king, who was just going to invite his future son−in−law to come to the banquet when
a eunuch from the inner quarters of the palace reported to him, "Your Majesty, Her Majesty the Queen asks
you to come." The king then withdrew to the inner quarters of the palace, where the queens of the three
palaces and the consorts of the six compounds brought the princess to the Sunlight Palace to talk and joke
together. The place was truly a mass of flowers or brocade. The magnificence and beauty was more than a
match for the halls of heaven or the moon's pavilions; nor was it inferior to the jade palaces of immortals.
There are four new lyrics on the "Happy Gathering and Splendid Wedding" about it. The lyric "Happy" goes:
Happy! Happy!
Delight and bliss!
The wedding is celebrated
With its love and beauty.
Elegant court dresses
That the Lady of the Moon could never rival;
Dragon and phoenix hairpins,
Sumptuous threads of flying gold.
Cherry lips, white teeth and rouge−red cheeks
Sylphs with forms as delicate as flowers.
Brocades upon brocades,
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1318
An extravagance of color,
Full of fragrance,
A host of princesses.
The lyric "Gathering" goes:
Gathering! Gathering!
Bewitching charms,
Rivaling the great beauties of the past,
Enough to topple a city or a state,
Like flowers or jade.
Dressed to make them lovelier still,
Even more dazzling in their finery,
And the splendor of their jewels.
Their orchid hearts and natures were pure and lofty;
Noble were their powder−white faces and ice−smooth skin.
The lines of their painted eyebrows were like distant hills;
They formed a throng of willowy elegance.
The lyric "Splendid" goes:
Splendid! Splendid!
Jade girls, fairy maidens,
Utterly adorable,
Truly to be admired,
Perfumed with fine fragrances,
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1319
Adorned with cosmetics.
Although far from the Tiantai paradise,
This was no mere palace of a king.
Sweet were their smiling words
As the sound of pipes and songs was wafted around.
A thousand beauties, massed flowers, a splendid brocade:
How could its match be found in the world?
The lyric "Wedding" goes:
Wedding! Wedding!
Orchid Fragrance,
Ranks of fairy girls,
Crowds of beauties.
The royal concubines have put on new splendor;
The princesses are in fresh garments.
Piled clouds of raven hair,
Rainbow gowns over phoenix skirts.
Soft music of immortals,
Two rows of purple and red.
In the past they pledged to ride in one phoenix chariot;
This morning is the happy occasion and the splendid wedding.
When the king arrived his queens and consorts led the princess and the other palace ladies out to meet him.
The delighted king took them into the Sunlight Palace to sit down. When the queens, consorts and others had
made their obeisances the king said, "Princess, my good daughter, we think that your heart's desire was
fulfilled when you had the good fortune to find the holy monk by throwing your ball from the decorated tower
on the eighth. The officials of all the departments have been most understanding of our wishes, so that
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1320
everything is now ready. As today is a lucky one let us hurry to the nuptial banquet and not be late."
The princess stepped forward, went down in a kowtow, and submitted this petition: "Your Majesty my father,
I beg you to forgive your daughter for her effrontery, but I have a request to make. In the last few days it has
been reported in the inner quarters of the palace that the Tang Priest has three extremely hideous disciples. I
couldn't bring myself to see them: I'm afraid the sight would terrify me. So I beg you, Father, to send them out
of the city. Otherwise the shock might be too much for my trail health and lead to disaster."
"If you had not mentioned them, child," the king replied, "we would have very nearly forgotten about them.
They are indeed rather ugly, and for the last few days we have had them entertained in the Lingering Spring
Pavilion. When we go into the throne hall this morning we will return their passport and tell them to leave the
city so that we can hold our banquet." The princess then kowtowed again in thanks, after which the king left
in his carriage to enter the throne hall and issue a decree inviting his son−in−law and the other three
gentlemen to attend.
Now the Tang Priest had been following the dates by counting on his fingers, so when he reached the twelfth
he had a discussion with his three disciples before dawn. "It is the twelfth today," he said. "How are we to
cope?"
"I've already noticed something of an ill−omened air about the king," Brother Monkey replied, "but the evil
hasn't actually infected him or done any great harm. The only thing is that I've not yet had a look at the
princess. If she comes out and lets me take a peep at her I'll know whether she's an impostor or not, then I'll do
something. Don't worry. He's bound to summon us now and send us three away from the city. Accept the
invitation and don't be afraid. I'll slip back and stay close to you to protect you." As master and disciples were
talking a royal equerry did indeed come with officials from the protocol office to bring an invitation.
"Let's go," said Monkey, "let's go. I'm sure they're going to see us three on our way and keep you here,
Master, for the wedding."
"If they're seeing us off they're bound to give us hundreds and thousands of ounces of gold and silver," said
Pig. "We'll be able to buy some presents to take home with us. When I get back to my in−laws' place I'll be
able to have a bit of fun again."
"Shut up, second brother," said Friar Sand, "and stop talking such nonsense. We'll do what big brother says."
They then followed the officials to the foot of the throne hall steps, taking baggage and horse with them.
When the king had greeted them he commanded Monkey and the other two to come forward. "Hand your
passport up," he said, "and we shall seal it, sign it and return it to you. You three gentlemen will be generously
provided with funds for your journey and escorted on your way to see the Buddha on Vulture Peak. If you
come back with the scriptures you will also receive generous rewards. We shall keep our son−in−law here:
there will be no need for you to worry about him."
Monkey thanked the king, then told Friar Sand to take the passport out and hand it over. The king read it,
sealed and signed it, then brought out ten ingots of gold and twenty of silver that he wanted to present to them
as gifts for his in−laws. Pig, who always had been very keen on money and sex, stepped forward to accept
them.
Monkey then gave a respectful chant and said, "We've disturbed you."
As Monkey turned to go Sanzang hastily scrambled to his feet, grabbed hold of him, and said through
clenched teeth, "You are all abandoning me."
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1321
Brother Monkey pinched the palm of Sanzang's hand, gave him a meaningful look and said, "Unwind and
take your pleasure here while we go to fetch the scriptures. We'll call on you on our way back." Not knowing
whether to believe this or not, the venerable elder refused to let him go. When all the officials saw this they
took it for a real parting. Soon the king invited his son−in−law back into the throne hall, ordering the officials
to escort the three gentlemen out of the city, whereupon Sanzang had to let go of Monkey and enter the hall.
As Brother Monkey and the other two went out through the palace gates they each took their leave.
"Are we really going?" asked Pig. Monkey said nothing, and just walked back to the hostel, where the
superintendent received them and provided tea and a meal.
"You two stay here," Monkey said to Pig and Friar Sand, "and whatever you do, don't show your faces. If the
hostel superintendent asks what's happening, give him vague answers. Don't say anything. I'm going off to
look after the master."
The splendid Great Sage pulled out one of his hairs, blew on it with magic breath, called "Change!" and
turned it into his own double to stay in the hostel with Pig and Friar Sand, while he himself leapt up into mid
air in a flash, turning himself into a bee.
Yellow wings, sweet mouth and a sharp tail,
He dances wildly in the wind,
The brilliant thief of fragrance from the blossom
Who sways his way through willows and flowers.
With many a drenching for his troubles
He flies to and fro, but all in vain.
The thick delight be makes he never tastes;
All he can do is leave his fame behind.
Watch him as he flies lightly into the palace, where he saw the Tang Priest sitting on an embroidered stool at
the king's left, frowning and worried at heart. Flying up to his master's Vairocana mitre, Monkey crept
stealthily to his ear and said, "I'm here, Master, so don't fret." These words were heard by the Tang Priest
alone,−−none of the ordinary mortals had any hope of hearing them−−so he felt relief at last.
Before long a eunuch came with an invitation: "Your Majesty, the nuptial banquet is set out in the Jay Palace.
Her Majesty and the princess are awaiting you in the inner quarters. They invite Your Majesty and His
Excellency to go in for the wedding." Overwhelmed with happiness, the king went into the inner quarters with
his son−in−law. Indeed:
Journey to the West
Chapter 94 1322
The wicked king's love of flowers led to disaster;
When the dhyana mind starts thinking, each thought brings sorrow.
If you don't know how the Tang Priest escaped once in the inner quarters of the palace, listen to the
explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 95
False and True Form Combine When the Jade Hare is Captured
The True Female Is Converted and Meets With Spiritual Origin
The story tells how the Tang Priest was feeling thoroughly miserable as he accompanied the king into the
inner quarters, from where a great sound of drums and music arose and fine perfumes could be smelt. He kept
his head bowed, not daring to look up. Monkey, secretly very pleased, had fixed himself to the Vairocana
mitre, from where he used his magic light to look around with his fiery eyes and golden pupils. There were
two ranks of court ladies, making it seem like a palace of flowers or immortals, and finer than a spring breeze
blowing past a brocade screen. Indeed, they were
Graceful and charming,
Jadelike, and with ice−smooth skin.
Bewitching pairs more lovely than the girl of Chu,
Beauties two by two, rivaling the lady Xi Shi.
Their hair was coiled high like flying phoenixes;
Their eyebrows were just visible, low lines of distant hills.
Elegantly played the pipe and shawm;
Fast sounded flute and drum.
All the notes of the scale rang out,
Rising then falling again together.
Delightful were they as they danced and sang,
A carpet of flowers, every one of them lovely.
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1323
Seeing that his master was not in the least moved by this Monkey silently smacked his lips in admiration and
said, "What a fine monk! What a fine monk!
Dwelling amid splendor, his heart forms no attachment;
Walking through magnificence, his mind is not confused."
A little later the princess came out of the Jay Palace surrounded by the queens and consorts so greet the king
with cheers of "Long live the king! Long live the king!" This so alarmed the venerable elder that he trembled,
not knowing what to do.
By now Monkey had already noticed a touch of the demonic−−though nothing very vicious−−that could just
be made out in the aura above the princess's head. Monkey crawled quickly to Sanzang's ear and said, "The
princess is a fake, Master."
"If she is a fake," the venerable elder replied, "then how are we to make her turn back into her real form?"
"I'll give myself a magic body and catch her right here," said Monkey.
"That would terrify His Majesty," said Sanzang. "Wait till he and his queens have withdrawn before using
your magic."
Now Monkey had been impatient by nature all his life, so he could not restrain himself. With a great and
angry roar he resumed his true from, rushed up and grabbed the princess. "You're a fine, evil beast," he said
abusively. "You've had no end of luxury here, you impostor, but it wasn't enough for you. You're so
sex−crazed you had to try to trick my master and destroy his primal masculinity." This struck the king
speechless with fright, and made the queens and consorts fall about. The palace beauties all ran off to hide,
fleeing for their lives. It was just like
A roaring wind in spring,
The howling autumn gale.
When the roaring wind in spring blows through the wood
A thousand blossoms are shaken;
When the howling autumn gale hits the park
Ten thousand leaves all swirl and fly.
The tree peony beneath the balustrade is snapped;
Herbaceous peonies beside the balcony fall over.
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1324
Hibiscus on the pond's banks are shaken all about.
While chrysanthemums are flung in heaps at the foot of the terrace.
The delicate begonia collapses in the dust;
The fragrant rose is now sleeping in the wilds.
The spring wind smashes caltrop, lotus and pear;
Winter snows weigh down the plum tree's tender blossoms.
The petals of the pomegranate
Are scattered all around the inner courtyard;
The branches of the willow
Are blown sideways within the royal palace.
Fine blooms, and a night of raging wind and rain:
Countless red petals carpet the ground with brocade.
Sanzang hastily put his trembling arms round the king and said, "Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. It is only my
wicked disciple using his magical powers to find out whether she is an impostor or not."
Seeing that things were going badly for her, the evil spirit broke free, tore off her clothes, flung down her
jewelry and hair ornaments and ran to the shrine of the local deity in the palace garden. From here she brought
out a short club shaped like the head of a trip−hammer, with which she started hitting wildly at Monkey as she
turned quickly towards him. Monkey, who had caught up with her at once, struck back at her face with his
iron cudgel, Shouting and roaring at each other, the two of them started fighting in the palace gardens. Then
each began a great display of magic powers, riding clouds as they battled in mid air. In this fight
Great was the fame of the gold−banded cudgel;
No one had heard of the hammerhead club.
One of them was there to fetch the true scriptures;
The other was lingering for love of rare flowers.
Long had the demon known of the holy Tang Priest,
And she longed to mate with his primal seed−juices.
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1325
In a past year she had carried off the real princess,
And taken the form of the king's true daughter.
When she met the Great Sage, who saw her evil aura,
He could tell true from false as he came to save a life.
The murderous club was flung at the head;
The mighty iron cudgel struck back at the face.
Ranting and roaring, they were locked in struggle,
Filling the skies and blotting out the sun.
As the two of them battled in mid air they terrified the common people of the city, and struck fear into all the
officials at court. The venerable elder kept saying as he supported the king, "Don't be alarmed, and please tell
Her Majesty and all the others not to be afraid. Your princess is an impostor pretending to be her. When my
disciple has captured her you will be able to see whether she is good or evil." Some of the bolder consorts
brought clothes and jewelry to show the queen.
"These are what the princess wore. She tore them off and is fighting that monk up in the sky stark naked. She
must be an evil spirit." Only then did the king, queens and consorts come to their senses and look up into the
sky.
When the evil spirit and the Great Sage had been fighting for half a day without either emerging as victor
Monkey threw his cudgel up and called "Change!" One turned into ten, ten into a hundred, and a hundred into
a thousand. Half the sky was filled with writhing serpents and pythons striking wildly at the evil spirit. With a
flurry of her hands and feet she turned into a pure wind and fled into the azure sky. Monkey said a spell, took
all the iron cudgels back into a single cudgel, and went straight after her magic light.
As he approached the Western Gate of Heaven and saw the dazzling flags and banners Monkey shouted at the
top of his voice, "Heavenly gatekeepers, stop that evil spirit and don't let her get away." The gate was being
held by the Heavenly King Lokapala with the four great marshals Pang, Liu, Gou and Bi, who did indeed use
their weapons to block the way. As she could not get further she turned straight back and started fighting
Monkey with her short club.
As he wheeled his iron cudgel the Great Sage looked carefully at her and saw that one end of her club was
thick and one end thin, just like the lead of a trip−hammer used for hulling with a mortar, so he gave a furious
roar and shouted, "Beast! What's that implement you're holding? How dare you fight me with it? Surrender at
once or I'll smash your skull with a single blow from my cudgel."
Grinding her teeth, the evil spirit replied, "You don't know about this weapon of mine, so listen while I tell
you:
Its immortal root was a piece of mutton−fat jade,
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1326
Which took countless years to be worked into shape.
It was already mine when chaos was separated;
When the primal disorder was sorted out I came first.
Its origins cannot be compared with mere mortal things;
Its nature has always belonged to the highest heaven.
Embodying the golden light and the four images
With the auspicious vapors of the Five Elements and the Three Primaries.
Long did it live with me in the Moon Palace,
Staying beside me in the Cassia Hall.
For love of flowers I descended to the mortal world,
Coming to India as a beautiful impostor.
The only reason why I shared the King's pleasures
Was because I wanted my destined marriage with the Tang Priest.
How could you be so cruel as to ruin this fine mating,
Pursuing me and giving rein to your vicious nature?
Great is the fame of this implement of mine,
Which is older than your cudgel with gold bands.
It was a drug−pounding pestle in the Moon Palace:
One blow from this and a life is ended."
When Monkey heard this he replied with a mocking laugh, "Evil beast! If you used to live in the Toad Palace
you must have heard of my powers. How dare you argue with me! Turn back into your real self and surrender
at once if I'm to spare your life."
"I know you," the monster replied. "You're the Protector of the Horses who made great havoc in the palaces of
Heaven five hundred years ago. By rights I ought to give way to you, but because you've wrecked my
marriage I hate you as much as if you'd killed my mother and father. It's more than I can stand for. I'm going
to kill you, you Protector of the Horses, for breaking the laws of Heaven." The words Protector of the Horses
always infuriated the Great Sage, so the moment he heard them he flew into a great rage, lifted his iron cudgel
and struck at her face. The evil spirit swung her pestle in reply. A ferocious battle then ensued in front of the
Western Gate of Heaven. In this combat there were
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1327
A gold−banded cudgel,
A drug−pounding pestle,
Two immortals' weapons, a worthy match.
One had come down to earth for the sake of a marriage;
The other was there to protect the Tang Priest.
It was because the king was not a righteous one
And loved flowers that he attracted the evil spirit,
Causing today's bitter strife
As two of them gave Ml play to their stubbornness of heart.
Charging and rushing each other they strove for triumph;
In cutting words they fought on with their tongues.
Rare was the martial prowess of the medicine pestle,
But finer still was the iron cudgel's might.
A powerful golden light flashed at the heavenly gates;
Brilliantly coloured mists went right down to the earth.
After a dozen rounds of fighting to and fro
The evil spirit became too weak to resist.
When the evil spirit had fought another dozen or so rounds with Brother Monkey she could see how thick and
fast his blows were coming, and realized that she could not win. Feinting with her pestle, she shook herself
and fled due South in ten thousand beams of golden light with the Great Sage in pursuit. Suddenly they
reached a great mountain, where the evil spirit landed her golden light and disappeared into a cave. Monkey,
who was worried that she might escape, return to India and do some underhand harm to the Tang Priest, made
sure he could recognize the mountain then turned his cloud round and went straight back to the capital.
It was now about four in the afternoon. The king was clinging to Sanzang, shivering and shaking as he kept
saying, "Save me, holy monk!"
The consorts and queens were all in a panic as the Great Sage came down from the clouds with a cry of, "Here
I am, Master!"

"Stand still, Wukong," said Sanzang. "You must not alarm His Majesty. Now, I am asking you what in fact
happened about the imitation princess." Standing outside the Jay Palace, Monkey put his hands together in
front of his chest and said, "The imitation princess was an evil spirit. First of all I fought her for half a day,
and she couldn't beat me, so she turned into a pure wind and fled straight to the gates of heaven. I shouted to
the gods to block her way. She turned back into her real self and fought another dozen or so rounds with me.
Then she turned herself into golden light and fled due South to a mountain, beaten. I chased her as fast as I
could till I got to the mountain, but I couldn't find her anywhere. Then I came back because I was worried she
might come here to harm you."
When the king heard this he grabbed hold of the Tang Priest and asked, "If the false princess was an evil
spirit, where is my real princess?"
"When I've caught the false princess your real princess will turn up by herself," Monkey replied straight away.
When the queens and consorts heard this their fears vanished, and each of them came forward to bow and say,
"We beg you to rescue our real princess, holy monk, and sort out the light from the dark. You will be richly
rewarded."
"This is no place for us to talk," said Monkey. "I beg Your Majesty to go from the inner quarters to the throne
hall with my master. Her Majesty and the rest of them should all go back to the inner palace, and my
fellow−disciples Pig and Friar Sand should be sent for to protect my master so that I can go and subdue the
demon. That will keep a proper distinction between the inner and outer quarters of the palace, and spare me
from worrying. I am going to sort this out to show my sincerity."
The king accepted the suggestion and was boundlessly grateful. He led the Tang Priest out of the inner
quarters and straight to the throne hall. All the queens and consorts returned to the inner palace. A vegetarian
meal was ordered while Pig and Friar Sand were sent for. The two of them soon arrived. Monkey explained to
them both about what had happened and told them to guard the master carefully. The Great Sage set off by his
cloud somersault and flew up into mid air. All the officials in front of the throne hall looked up into the sky
and bowed low.
The Great Sage Monkey went straight to the mountain that lay due South. When the evil spirit had fled in
defeat to the mountain and gone into her den she blocked the entrance with boulders and lay hidden there,
terrified. Having looked around for a while and seen no sign of life Monkey felt very impatient, so he made a
spell with his hands and said the magic words, calling out the local deity and mountain god to be questioned.
A moment later the two gods arrived, kowtowed and said, "We didn't realize, we didn't realize. If we had
known we'd have gone a long way to meet you. We beg you to forgive us."
"I won't hit you just now," Monkey said. "Tell me what this mountain's called. How many evil spirits are there
here? Tell me the truth and I'll forgive you your crimes."
"Great Sage," the two gods replied, "this mountain is called Mount Hairtrip. There are three have warrens in
the mountain, but from remote antiquity there have never been any evil spirits here. This is a blessed land of
five felicities. Great Sage, if you want to find an evil spirit, take the road to the Western Heaven."
"I've reached the kingdom of India in the Western Heaven, where the king has a princess who was carried off
by an evil spirit and abandoned in the wilds. The evil spirit turned herself into the princess's double to deceive
the king into building a decorated tower from which she could throw an embroidered ball to find herself a
husband. When I got to the foot of the tower while escorting the Tang Priest she deliberately hit the Tang
Priest because she wanted to mate with him and lure his primal masculinity out of him. When I saw through
her I turned back into myself in the palace to catch her. She threw off her human clothes and jewels and
fought with me for half a day with a short club that she called a medicine−pounding pestle. Then she turned
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1329
herself into a pure wind and disappeared. When I chased her as far as the Western Gate of Heaven and fought
another dozen or more with her she realized she couldn't beat me, turned herself into golden right and fled
here. Why didn't you see her!"
When the two gods heard this they led Brother Monkey to search the three warrens. When they first looked by
the warren at the foot of the mountain a few frightened hares were startled and ran away. When their search
reached the cave at the top of the mountain they saw that the entrance was blocked with two great boulders.
"The evil spirit must have gone inside," the local god said, "when you were chasing her so hard."
Monkey then pried the boulders apart with his iron cudgel. The evil spirit, who was indeed hiding in there,
sprang out with a whoosh, raising her medicine pestle to strike him with. As Monkey swung his cudgel to
parry her blow the mountain deity fell back in terror and the local god fled.
From the demon's mouth came abusive grumbles: "Who told you to bring him here to find me?" She
continued to fend off the iron cudgel as she fled up into mid air in a fighting retreat.
Just at the moment of crisis, when it was getting late in the day, Monkey became more vicious than ever and
his blows were even harder. He wished he could finish her off with a single stroke. Just then a call came from
the ninefold azure sky of, "Don't strike, Great Sage! Don't strike! Be kind with your cudgel."
When Monkey turned round he saw that it was the Star Lord of the Moon leading his beauties and immortals
down on multicolored clouds to stand in front of him. A flustered Monkey at once put his iron cudgel away,
bowed and said, "Where are you going, Old Man? I'm sorry I didn't keep out of your way."
"The evil spirit fighting you is the Jade Hare who pounds the immortal elixir of mysterious dew in my
palace," the Moon replied. "A year ago she secretly opened the golden locks on the jade gates and absconded
from the palace. As I reckoned that she would be in mortal peril I have come here to save her life. I do beg
you, Great Sage, to spare her life out of consideration for me."
Monkey assented, saying only, "I wouldn't dare harm her, I wouldn't dare. No wonder she's so good with a
medicine−pounding pestle. She's the Jade Hare. What you don't know, Old Moon, is that she has kidnapped
the king of India's daughter, made herself into the princess's double, and wants to ruin my master's primal
masculinity although he's a holy monk. This is the truth. We can't stand for crimes like that. How can you
possibly let her off so lightly?"
"There are things you don't know," the Moon replied. "That king's daughter is no ordinary mortal. She was the
White Beauty from the Moon Palace. Eighteen years ago she slapped the Jade Hare, after which she longed
for the human world and came down to it in a beam of magic light to the womb of the king's senior queen.
She was born then. The Jade Hare was getting her own back for that slap when she ran away from the palace
last year and threw White Beauty into the wilds. But she was wrong to want to marry the Tang Priest. That's
an offence she mustn't get away with. It was a good thing you were careful enough to see through her before
she ruined your master. But I plead with you to forgive her for my sake and let me take her back."
"If that's why it happened," Brother Monkey replied with a smile, "I wouldn't dare to make any objections.
But if you take the Jade Hare back I'm worried that the king might not believe it, so I'd like to trouble you and
the immortal sisters to take the Jade Hare over there to prove it to the king. Then I'll be able to show off my
powers and explain how White Beauty came down to earth. I'll make the king fetch Princess White Beauty to
prove the truth of retribution.
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1330
The Moon was persuaded, so he pointed at the evil spirit and shouted, "Repent and submit, evil beast!" The
Jade Hare rolled on the ground and turned back into her real form. Indeed she was
Gap−lipped and sharp−toothed,
Long−eared and with few whiskers.
Her body was covered with jade−coloured fur;
When she stretched out her legs she flew over mountains.
Her straight nose was like yogurt,
Glossier than face−cream with powder.
Two eyes glowed red,
Brighter than dots of rouge on the snow.
Crouching on the ground
She was a heap of pure white silk;
When she stretched herself out
She was a structure of dazzling silver wire.
Often did she
Drink in the purest dew of the heavenly dawn,
Pounding the elixir with her pestle of jade.
When the Great Sage saw this he was delighted, and treading clouds and light he led the way as the Moon
Lord brought all the beauties and immortals, taking the Jade Hare with them as they headed straight for India.
It was now dusk, and the moon was slowly rising. When they reached the walls of the capital they heard the
drums being beaten on the watch−towers. The king and the Tang Priest were still inside the throne hall, while
Pig, Friar Sand and the officials were standing in front of the steps. They were just discussing whether the
king should withdraw when a sheet of coloured cloud as bright as day was seen due South.
When they all raised their heads to look they heard the Great Sage Monkey shouting at the top of his voice,
"Your Majesty, King of India, ask your queens and consorts to come out and look. Under this canopy is the
Star Lord of the Moon Palace, and the immortal sisters to either side of him are the beauties of the moon. This
Jade Hare was the bogus princess of yours who has now turned back into her real form." The king then
quickly called his queen, consorts, palace beauties and maids out, and they all kowtowed towards the sky. The
king, the Tang Priest and the officials also bowed to the sky in thanks. There was nobody in any house
throughout the whole city who did not set out an altar on which to burn incense, kowtow and recite the name
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1331
of the Buddha.
Just when everyone was looking up Pig felt a surge of uncontrollable desire, leapt up into the air and flung his
arms round an immortal girl dressed in a rainbow. "We're old Mends, darling," he said. "Let's go and have a
bit of fun." Monkey went up to Pig, grabbed hold of him, gave him a couple of slaps and swore at him: "You
village idiot. What sort of place is this for getting randy?"
"I was just going to chat her up for a bit of fun," said Pig.
The Moon Lord had his celestial canopy turned about as he took the Jade Hare straight back to the Moon
Palace with all his beauties. Brother Monkey threw Pig down into the dust, then was thanked by the king in
the throne hall.
When the king was told what had happened he said, "We are very grateful to you, holy monk, for using your
great magical powers to capture the imitation princess. But where is our real daughter?"
"She is no ordinary human either," Monkey replied, "but the immortal girl White Beauty from the Moon
Palace. Because she slapped the Jade Hare in the face eighteen years ago she yearned for the lower world,
came down to the womb of Your Majesty's senior queen and was born here. It was because the Jade Hare
nursed her old grudge that she surreptitiously opened the golden lock on the jade gate's, came down here,
abandoned White Beauty in the wilds and made herself look like White Beauty to deceive you. The Moon
Lord himself told me about this chain of events. Today we've got rid of the imposter, and tomorrow I'll invite
Your Majesty to go in your royal carriage to fetch the real one."
This came as rather a shock to the king, who said with the tears streaming down his cheeks, "Daughter! In all
the time since we came to the throne as a child we have never even gone outside the city gates. Where are we
to go to look for you?"
"No need to upset yourself," said Monkey with a smile. "Your daughter is now in the Almsgiver's Spread
Gold Monastery, pretending to be mad. Everyone can go home now. Tomorrow morning I'll bring your real
princess back to you."
"Please stop worrying, Your Majesty," the officials all said, kowtowing. "These holy monks are all Buddhas
who can ride clouds and mists: they are sure to know all about causes and effects in the future and the past. If
we trouble the holy monks to come with us tomorrow to look for her we will learn the truth."
Accepting their suggestion, the king invited the monks to the Lingering Spring Pavilion, where a vegetarian
meal was provided and they were to spend the night. By now it was almost the second watch. Indeed:
The copper water−clock drips in the moon's bright glow;
The chimes of the golden bell are carried by the wind.
When the cuckoo sings the spring is half−way gone;
The blossoms fall aimlessly as the third watch draws near.
The swing casts a shadow in deserted royal gardens;
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1332
The silver river spans the sky's blue vault.
No travelers are to be seen in markets and streets;
The constellations make the night sky shine.
That night they all went to bed, and of that no more need be said.
During the night the king lost his demonic aura, and his spirit grew with great speed, so that at three marks
after the fifth watch he came out of the inner quarters to give audience once more. When the audience was
over he ordered that the Tang Priest and his three disciples be fetched to discuss the search for the princess.
Sanzang then came and did obeisance to the king, while the Great Sage and the other two also paid their
respects. The king bowed to them and said, "Yesterday you spoke of our daughter the princess. May we
trouble you divine monks to find and rescue her?"
"The day before yesterday we had been walking from the East till evening," the venerable elder replied,
"when we saw the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery. We went inside to ask for accommodation and had
the good fortune to be entertained by the monks there. After supper I took a moonlight stroll in the former
Spread Gold Garden, and as I was looking at the remains I heard wailing. When I asked what it was all about,
an ancient monk, over a hundred years old, sent everyone else away before telling me, 'Now, about that
wailing, in the late spring of last year I was enjoying the moon when suddenly heard a gust of wind and the
sound of someone grieving. I got out of bed, went into the Jetavana and saw a girl there. When I questioned
her the girl said, "I am a princess, the daughter of the king of India. The wind blew me here when I was
looking at the flowers by moonlight."' The ancient monk knows a lot about correct behavior, so he locked the
princess up in a quiet, out−of−the−way cell. As he was worried that the monks of the monastery might sully
her he put it about that he had locked up an evil spirit. The princess, who understood what he was doing,
ranted and raved during the day and demanded food and tea. Only late at night, when there was nobody about,
did she think of her mother and father and cry for them. The ancient monk did come to the capital to make
enquiries several times, but when he found that the princess was well and in the palace he didn't dare say
anything or submit a memorial. When the ancient monk saw that my disciple had some magic powers he
repeatedly insisted that we were to come here to investigate. I never expected that she would turn out to be the
Jade Hare from the Moon Palace who had put on an imitation of the real body and made herself look like the
princess. She was also set on ruining my primal masculinity. Fortunately my disciple showed his mighty
magic and detected the fraud. The Jade Hare has now been recaptured by the Moon Lord. Your worthy
princess is now pretending to be crazy in the Spread Gold Monastery."
After hearing the story in all this detail the king started to weep aloud. This soon alarmed the queens and
consorts of the three palaces and six compounds, who all came out to ask why. Everybody began to weep
bitterly, and it was a long time before the king asked, "How far is the Spread Gold Monastery from the city?"
"Only twenty miles," Sanzang replied.
The king then issued these commands: "Let the Queens of the Eastern and Western Palaces look after the
court while the High Minister takes charge of the nation's business. We are going to the monastery with our
Senior Queen, our officials and the four holy monks to fetch the princess."
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1333
Carriages were at once prepared and a line of them left the palace. Watch as Brother Monkey sprang up into
the air and with a bend of his back was the first to reach the monastery. The monks all hastily knelt to greet
him.
"When you left, sir," they said, "you walked with the others, so why did you come down from the sky today?"
To this Monkey replied with a smile, "Where is your ancient teacher? Ask him to come out straight away, and
set out incense tables to welcome His Majesty. The king and queen of India, the officials and my master are
all coming." The monks could not understand what he meant, so they asked the ancient monk to come out.
When the ancient monk saw Monkey he prostrated himself before him with the words, "What has happened
about the princess, sir?" Monkey told him all about how the imitation princess had thrown the embroidered
ball, wanted to mate with the Tang Priest, been chased, fought, and been recaptured by the Moon Lord as the
Jade Hare. The ancient monk kowtowed to him again in thanks.
"Please stop kowtowing," said Monkey, helping him up, "please stop. Hurry up and get ready to receive His
Majesty." Only then did the monks realize that it was a girl locked up in the garden at the back. Surprised and
delighted, they all set out a row of incense tables outside the monastery gates, put on their cassocks and
started striking the bell and the drum. Soon after this the king's carriage arrived. Indeed:
The sky is filled with clouds of holy incense;
Sudden blessing comes to the monastery.
The rainbow flows for a thousand years; rivers and seas are pure.
The eternal spring round which lightning flickers is finer than those of Yu and Tang.
Thanks to the royal grace the plants' colours are finer than ever;
The wild flowers have extra fragrance because of this generosity.
Men of distinction have always left their mark behind them;
Today all rejoice at an enlightened king's arrival.
When the king arrived outside the monastery gates the monks were all lined up on their knees in orderly
ranks, bowing low in greeting. Monkey stood in the middle. "How did you arrive first, holy monk?" the king
asked.
"It just took a little bend of my waist for me to get here," Monkey replied.
"Why were you such a long time coming?" After this the Tang Priest and the others all arrived. He led the
royal carriage to the building at the back where the princess was still raving and pretending to be crazy.
The ancient monk knelt down, pointed towards her and said, "This is Her Royal Highness the princess who
was blown here by a wind the other year." The king ordered the cell opened. When the iron locks were
Journey to the West
Chapter 95 1334
undone and the door opened the king and queen saw and recognized the princess.
Not caring about the filth, they went up to her and threw their arms round her. "Our poor child," they said,
"how did you come to suffer these torments and have so terrible a time here?" How true it is that the meeting
of parents and child is not like that of other people. The three of them sobbed aloud, their arms round each
other's heads. When they had cried for a while and told each other what had happened since they were parted,
scented hot water was sent for. The princess bathed and changed her clothes before they all climbed into
carriages to go back to the capital.
Monkey then put his hands together in greeting to the king and said, "I have something else to put to you,
Your Majesty."
"Say it, whatever it is, holy monk," the king said, returning his greeting, "and we will do as you ask."
"This mountain of theirs," Monkey replied, "is called Mount Hundredfoot. They tell me that centipedes have
been turning into spirits here recently and injuring people by night. This is very awkward for travelling
merchants. As I see it, only chickens can deal with centipedes, so a thousand extra−large cockerels should be
chosen and then scattered across the mountainside to get rid of these venomous insects. The mountain could
be renamed and you could make a land grant to these monks to thank them for looking after the princess."
This suggestion pleased the king greatly, and he accepted it. Officials were then sent back to the city to fetch
cocks, while the mountain was renamed Mount Splendor. The Department of Works was instructed to provide
the materials for the monastery to be rebuilt, a deed of enfeoffment was written describing the mountain as
"Mount Splendor, granted to the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery," and the ancient monk was given the
title National Benefactor Hierarch, a title that was to be handed on to his successors in perpetuity, together
with a stipend of thirty−six bushels of grain. The monks all thanked the king for his kindness and saw him off
on his way back to the capital. Here the princess returned to the inner palace and was greeted by all the ladies
in turn. A banquet was then laid on to cheer the princess up and congratulate her on her deliverance. The
queen and her daughter were reunited; king and ministers were together. We will not describe the night's
feasting.
Early the next morning the king ordered that painters make portraits of the countenances of the four holy
monks to be kept in the Sino−Barbarian Hall. The princess was also invited to come out from the throne hall
in her new finery to thank the Tang Priest and the other three for saving her from her suffering. When she had
thanked them the Tang Priest took his leave of the king to continue his journey West. The king refused to let
them go, but ordered great banquets at which they feasted for five or six days. The idiot really was given a
good time, and he enjoyed putting as much food in his stomach as he possibly could. When the king saw how
determined they were to visit the Buddha he realized that no matter how hard he tried he would not be able to
keep them. He had two hundred ingots of gold and silver brought out, as well as a tray of jewels for each of
them as an expression of thanks. Master and disciples refused to accept anything. The king then ordered the
royal carriage prepared, invited the master to enter it, and instructed officials to escort them a long way. The
queens, consorts, officials and common people all kowtowed endlessly in thanks. As they went along the way
their monks all came out to kowtow to them in farewell; none of them could bear to be parted from the
travelers. Seeing that the people seeing them off were unwilling to turn back. Monkey had no option but to
make a spell with his hands and blow a magic breath in the direction of the trigram of the wind, Xun, so that a
dark wind stopped all the escorts from seeing them. Only then did the travelers get away. This was indeed a
case of

Chapter 96
Squire Kou Entertains the Lofty Monk
The Tang Priest Does Not Covet Wealth and Honour
All kinds of matter are really without matter;
No emptiness is truly empty.
Stillness and clamour, speech and silence, all are the same:
Why bother to dream−talk in one's dreams?
The useful includes the useless in its application;
Achievement lurks within failure.
When the fruit is ripe it reddens of itself;
Do not ask how the seed is to be grown.
The story has told how the Tang Priest and his disciples used their magic powers to stop the monks of the
Spread Gold Monastery. When the monks saw after the black wind had passed that the master and his
disciples had disappeared they thought that their visitors must have been living Buddhas come down to earth,
so they kowtowed and went back. Of them we tell no more. As master and disciples traveled West spring was
giving way to early summer:
The air was clear, mild and refreshing;
Water chestnuts and lotuses were growing in the pool.
Plums were ripening after the rain;
The wheat was forming as the breezes blew.
Flowers were fragrant where blossoms fell from trees;
The oriole grew tired amid the willow's light branches.
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1336
Swallows over the river taught their young to fly;
The pheasants fed their chirping chicks.
South of the Dipper the sun was always seen;
All of creation shone with brightness.
We could never describe in full how they ate at dawn, found shelter at dusk, rounded ravines and climbed hills
as they went along their way without incident for a fortnight. Then another city wall appeared in front of
them. As they came closer to it Sanzang asked, "What sort of place is this, disciple?"
"I don't know," Brother Monkey replied, "I don't know."
"You've been this way before," put in Pig, "so how can you claim that you don't know? I suppose you're being
crafty and just pretending you can't recognize the place to make fools of us."
"You're being completely unreasonable, you idiot," said Monkey. "Although I've been this way several times
I've always come and gone by cloud high up in the sky. I've never landed here. I had no interest in the place,
so why should I have looked it over? That's why I didn't know. I'm not being crafty, and not trying to make a
fool of you either."
While they were talking they came close to the city before they realized it. Sanzang dismounted, crossed the
drawbridge and went straight in through the gates. As they went along the main street there were two old men
to be seen sitting under a portico and talking.
"Disciples," said Sanzang, "stand here in the middle of the road, keep your heads bowed and don't run wild. I
am going under that portico to ask where we are."
Monkey and the others stood still as they had been told while the venerable elder went up to the two men, put
his hands together and called out, "Greetings, benefactors." The two old men were idly chatting about such
things as prosperity and decay, success and failure, sages and good men, their heroic deeds in ancient times,
and where such men were now. Really, they said, it was enough to make you sigh.
When they suddenly heard Sanzang's greeting they returned it and asked, "What do you have to say to us,
reverend sir?"
"I am a monk who has come from far away to worship the Lord Buddha," Sanzang replied, "and I have just
arrived here. I wonder what this place is called, and where there are any pious folk from whom I might beg a
meal."
"This is the prefecture of Brazentower," one of the old men said, "and this is the county of Diling near
Brazentower city. If you want vegetarian food, reverend sir, you won't need to beg. Go past this archway to
the street running North−south. There's a gate−tower shaped like a sitting tiger facing the East, and that's
Squire Kou's house. In front of it is a sign that says 'All monks welcome'. A monk from far away such as
yourself will be given all you want. Off you go, and stop interrupting our conversation."
Sanzang thanked them, turned to Monkey and said, "This is Diling county in the prefecture of Brazentower.
The two old men said that on the street running North−south past this archway there is a gate−tower shaped
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1337
like a sitting tiger that is Squire Kou's house. In front of it is a sign that says 'All monks welcome'. They told
me to go there for a vegetarian meal."
"The West is a land of Buddhists," said Friar Sand, "and they really do feed monks. As this is only a seat of
local government we don't need to present our passport. Let's go and beg ourselves a meal; that'll be all the
better for travelling with." The master and his three disciples walked slowly along the main street, filling all
the people in the market with alarm and suspicion as they crowded around, struggling to see what the
strangers looked like.
Sanzang told his disciples to keep their mouths shut, saying, "Behave yourselves! Behave yourselves!" The
three of them kept their heads bowed, not daring to look up. Then they turned a corner and did indeed see a
main road running North−south.
As they were walking along it they saw a gate−tower like a sitting tiger. On a screen wall inside the gateway
hung a great sign on which were written the words "All monks welcome."
"The West is indeed the land of the Buddha," said Sanzang. "Nobody, however clever or stupid, is dishonest. I
did not believe what the two old men told me. Now I know it is just as they said." Being the boor that he was,
Pig wanted to go straight in.
"Just a moment, idiot," said Monkey. "Wait till someone comes out so we can ask what to do before we go
in."
"Big brother's right," said Friar Sand. "If we don't show respect for his privacy we might irritate the
benefactor." They let the horse rest and put down the luggage outside the gates. A little later a slave came out
with a steelyard and a basket in his hands that the sudden sight of the strangers made him drop in alarm.
"Master," he reported, running inside, "here are four strange−looking monks outside." At the time the
gentleman was walking with a stick in the inner courtyard, reciting the name of the Buddha. When he heard
the report he dropped his stick and went out to welcome them. Their ugliness did not frighten him.
"Come in, come in," he said. Behaving with all courtesy, Sanzang went inside with him.
The gentleman led them along a passageway and into a house, where he said, "The upper building includes a
Buddha hall, a surra library and a refectory for you gentlemen. The lower building is where your disciple's
family lives." Sanzang expressed endless admiration. He brought out and put on his cassock to worship the
Buddha, then went up into the hall to have a look. What he saw was:
Clouds of incense,
Dazzling candles.
The−ball was filled with a brocade of flowers;
All around was gold and many colours.
From red frames
Hung a bell of purple gold;
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1338
On a lacquered stand
Was set a matching decorated drum.
Several pairs of banners
Were embroidered with the eight treasures;
A thousand Buddha statues
Were all covered in gold.
Ancient bronze incense−burners,
Ancient bronze vases,
Carved lacquer tables,
Carved lacquer boxes.
In the ancient bronze incense−burners
Was always eaglewood incense;
In the ancient bronze vases
Were the colours of lotus blossoms.
On the carved lacquer tables
Were fresh fruits;
In the carved lacquer boxes
Fragrant petals were piled.
In glass bowls
Was pure, clear water;
In crystal lamps
The fragrant oil shone bright.
A metal chime
Resounded long and slow.
This was like a treasure house untouched by the world,
A family Buddha hall rivaling a monastery.
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1339
The venerable elder washed his hands, took a pinch of incense, kowtowed and worshipped, then turned back
to greet the gentleman.
"Wait a moment," Mr. Kou replied. "Let us make our introductions in the sutra library." What they saw there
was:
A square stand and upright cupboards,
Jade boxes and golden caskets.
On the square stand and in the upright cupboards
Were piled up countless scriptures;
In the jade boxes and golden caskets
Were stored many a manuscript.
On lacquered tables
Were paper, ink, brushes and inkstones,
All the finest treasures of the study.
Before the scented screen
Were calligraphy, paintings, a lute and chess,
All for the most refined of interests.
A magic chime of light jade covered with gold,
And a copper tripod in the wind and under the moon.
The clear breeze freshens the spirit;
The purified heart is aware; the mind set on the Way is at ease.
When the venerable elder had reached the library and was going to bow to him Mr. Kou held on to prevent
this and said, "Won't you take off your cassock?" Sanzang then took off his cassock, after which he greeted
Mr. Kou. He then told Monkey and the other two to greet him too. Orders were given for the horse to be fed
and the luggage put in a corridor. The gentleman asked about their background.
"I have been sent by the emperor of Great Tang in the East," Sanzang said, "to the Vulture Peak in your
splendid country to see the Lord Buddha and ask for the true scriptures. I am here to request a meal because I
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1340
have heard that in your distinguished household you honour monks. After that we will be on our way."
The gentleman's face was suffused with pleasure as he replied with a chuckle, "My name is Kou Hong, my
other name is Kou Dakuan, and I have lived for sixty−four wasted years. When I was forty I made a vow to
feed ten thousand monks, and you will complete the number. In the twenty−four years during which I have
been feeding monks I have kept a record of their names. Having nothing else to do in recent days I have
counted the names of all the monks I've fed, and the score is now 9,996. I was only short of four to make up
the full number. Then today heaven has you four teachers down to me to complete the ten thousand. Will you
be so good as to tell me your names? I hope that you will stay for a month or more until I have celebrated the
completion, after which I will send you teachers up the mountain in carrying−chairs or on horses. Vulture
Peak is only some 250 miles from here, not at all far away." Sanzang was thoroughly delighted to hear this,
and he agreed to it all at once.
Several young and old servants fetched firewood, drew water, and brought rice, flour and vegetables into the
house with which to prepare them a meal. All this disturbed the gentleman's wife, who said, "Where have
these monks come from, and why is everyone so busy?"
"Four eminent monks have just arrived," the servants told her, "and when the master asked them where they
were from they said they'd been sent by the emperor of the Great Tang in the East to go to worship the Lord
Buddha on Vulture Peak. Goodness only knows how far it is to here from there. The master said that they had
been sent down from heaven and told us to get them a vegetarian meal quickly."
The old woman was also very pleased to hear this, so she told a maid to fetch her clothes so that she too could
go to see them. "Only one of them is handsome, ma'am," the servant said. "The other three don't bear looking
at. They're really hideous."
"What you people don't realize," the old woman replied, "is that if they look ugly, strange and freakish they
must be heavenly beings come down to earth. Hurry and tell your master straight away."
The servant ran straight to the surra hall, where he said to the gentleman, "The old lady's here to pay her
respects to the lords from the East." On hearing this Sanzang rose from his seat. Before the words had all been
spoken the old woman was already before the hall, where she lifted her eyes to see the Tang Priest's majestic
countenance and his splendid bearing. When she turned to see the extraordinary appearance of Monkey and
the other two she was somewhat alarmed even though she knew they were heavenly beings come down to
earth; she fell to her knees and bowed.
Sanzang quickly returned her courtesy, saying, "Bodhisattva, the honour you do me is undeserved." The old
woman then asked her husband why the four reverend gentlemen were not all sitting together.
"We three are disciples," said Pig, thrusting his snout forward. Goodness! His voice was like the roar of a tiger
deep in the mountains. The old woman was terrified.
As they were talking another servant appeared to announce, "The two young masters are here too." When
Sanzang turned quickly round to look he saw that they were two young scholars, who prostrated themselves to
the venerable elder after walking into the sutra hall. Sanzang was quick to return their courtesy. Mr. Kou then
came up to take hold of him and say, "These are my two sons. Their names are Kou Liang and Kou Dong.
They have just come back from their school and have not yet had their lunch. They are here to pay their
respects because they have heard that you teachers have come down to earth."
"What fine sons," said Sanzang with delight, "what fine sons. Indeed:
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1341
If you want to make a lofty match you must do good:
The success of your sons and grandsons depends on study."
The two scholars then asked their father, "Where have these lords come from?"
"From a long way away," Mr. Kou replied with a smile. "The emperor of Great Tang in the East of the
Southern Continent of Jambu has sent them to Vulture Peak to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the
scriptures."
"We have read in the Compendious Forest of Facts that there are four continents in the world," the scholars
said. "This continent of ours is the Western Continent of Cattle−gift. There is also an Eastern Continent of
Superior Body. How many years did it take you to get here?"
"I have been a long time on the journey," Sanzang replied with a smile, "met many vicious demons and
monsters, and suffered greatly. I have been greatly indebted to my three disciples for their protection.
Altogether it has taken me fourteen winters and summers to reach your splendid country."
When the scholars heard this they said with unbounded admiration, "You really are holy monks, you really
are."
Before they had finished speaking a servant came in to invite them to eat: "The vegetarian banquet has been
set out, so will you eat, my lords?" The gentleman then sent his wife and sons back to the house, while he
went with the four monks into the refectory for the meal. Everything was set out very neatly. There were
gold−lacquered tables and black−lacquered chairs. In front were fine cakes of many colours that skilled chefs
had made up in up−to−date styles. The second row contained five dishes of hors−d'oeuvres, in the third row
there were five dishes of fruit, and in the fourth were five large dishes of snacks. Everything tasted good,
looked good and smelt good. Vegetable soup, rice and steamed breadrolls were all spicy, piping hot, and most
delicious. There was plenty to fill one's stomach. Seven or eight servants rushed around waiting on them,
while four of five cooks were kept constantly busy. Just watch while some poured soup and others filled the
rice bowls, coming and going like shooting stars chasing the moon. Pig was finishing up bowls in single
mouthfuls, like a gale blowing the clouds away. Thus master and disciples ate their fill. Sanzang then rose to
thank Mr. Kou for the meal before setting out again.
The gentleman blocked his way saying, "Teacher, won't you take things easy and spend a few days here? As
the saying goes, it's nothing to start a journey but it's hard to end one. I will send you on your way when we
have celebrated the completion of my vow." Seeing how sincere and determined he was, Sanzang had no
option but to stay.
Five to seven days quickly passed before Mr. Kou engaged twenty−four local Buddhist monks to perform a
mass to celebrate the fulfillment of the vow. The monks spent three or four days writing texts out and chose a
lucky day on which to begin the Buddhist service. The way they did it was like in the Great Tang. There was
A great display of banners,
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1342
Where the golden countenance was set out;
Rows of candles
And incense burnt in offering.
Drums and gongs were beaten,
Pipes and shawms were played.
Cloud−cymbals,
Pure−toned flutes,
Sounded in tune;
To the beat of the drum,
And the woodwind's notes,
The words of sutras were recited in unison.
First the local god was put at ease,
Then spirit generals were invited to come.
The documents were sent out,
And they bowed low to the Buddha statues,
Reciting the Peacock Sutra,
Each word of which could sweep away disasters,
A stand of lamps was lit for Bhaisajya−guru,
To shine with flames of dazzling brightness.
They performed the Water Ceremony
To end any sense of grievance.
Then they intoned the Avatamsaka Sutra
To do away with slander.
The Three Vehicles of the Wonderful Law are very fine:
Different monks are all the same.
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1343
The mass lasted for three days and nights before it ended. In his longing to go to the Thunder Monastery the
Tang Priest was determined to be on his way, so he took his leave of them and thanked them.
"Teacher, you are very eager to say good−bye," Mr. Kou said. "I suppose you must have taken offence
because for days on end we have been so busy with our service that we have treated you very offhandedly."
"We have put your noble house to a great deal of trouble," Sanzang replied, "and I do not know how we will
ever repay you. How could we possibly have taken offence? But when my wise monarch saw me off through
the passes all those years ago he asked me when I would be back. I wrongly told him that I would return in
three years, never imagining that the journey would be so badly delayed that it has already lasted fourteen
years. I do not even know whether I will succeed in fetching the scriptures, and it will take me another twelve
or thirteen years to get back. How am I to face the penalty for breaking my monarch's sage command? I beg
you, sir, to let me go to fetch the scriptures and return. Next time I come to your mansion I will be able to stay
much longer."
This was more than Pig could bear. "You don't care at all about what we want, Master," he shouted at the top
of his voice. "You're showing no consideration at all. The old gentleman's very rich, and now he's fulfilled his
vow to feed monks. Besides, he's really sincere about wanting to keep us here. It'd do no harm if we stayed
here for a year or so. Why be so set on going? Why leave all this good food to go begging for meals
elsewhere? Is it your parents' home ahead?"
"All you care about is food, you cretin," shouted Sanzang angrily. "You don't care at all about the transference
of cause and effect. Really, you're such an animal you'd eat from the trough to scratch the itch in your belly. If
you people are going to be so greedy and stupid I'll go by myself tomorrow."
Seeing that the master's attitude had changed, Monkey grabbed hold of Pig and punched his head. "You've got
no sense, you idiot," he said abusively. "You've made the master angry with us too."
"He deserved that," said Friar Sand with a grin, "he deserved that. He's disgusting enough even if he doesn't
say a word, but he would have to interrupt." Breathing heavily, the idiot stood to one side, not daring to say
another word.
Seeing the anger of master and disciple, Mr. Kou said, his face wreathed in smiles, "Do not be so
short−tempered, teacher. Make yourself comfortable for the rest of the day. Tomorrow I will have banners and
drums brought here and ask some relations and neighbors to come to see you off."
As they were talking the old woman come out again to say. "Venerable teacher, as you have come to our
house you should not refuse too insistently. How many days have you spent here now?"
"It is already a fortnight," Sanzang replied.
"That fortnight is my gentleman's achievement," the old woman said. "I have a little pin−money with which I
would like to entertain you gentlemen for another fortnight."
Before she had finished speaking Kou Dong and his brother came out again to say, "Your four lordships, in
the twenty and more years during which our father has been feeding monks he has never met better ones than
yourselves. Now that by your gracious condescension you have made up the total you really have brought
glory to our thatched hovel. We two are too young to understand about cause and effect, but we have often
heard it said,
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1344
The husband gets what he has merited,
The wife gets what she has merited;
Nothing is got when nothing is merited.
Our father and mother each want to make a humble offering in order that each of them may merit a reward, so
why must you refuse so insistently? And as we two brothers have saved a little of our school fees we hope to
be allowed to support you gentlemen for another fortnight before seeing you on your way.
"I dare not accept even the lavish hospitality of the venerable Bodhisattva your mother," Sanzang replied, "so
how could I accept you brothers' generosity? I could not possibly do so. I really must set out today. Please,
please do not take offence. If I do not go now I will be unable to avoid execution for exceeding my emperor's
time−limit by so long."
When the old woman and her two sons realized that Sanzang was determined not to stay they started losing
their patience.
"We invite you very nicely to stay," they said, "but you're obstinately set on going. If you're going, go, and cut
out this chatter." Mother and sons then left to go back to the house. Pig could hold his tongue no longer.
"Master," he said to the Tang Priest, "don't overdo it. As the saying goes, 'If you can stay, don't go away.' Let's
stay here for another month to let the mother and her sons fulfil their wishes. Why do you have to be in such a
rush?" The Tang Priest made another angry noise at him and shouted again.
The idiot then slapped his own face twice, saying, "Tut, tut, tut. Don't talk out of turn. You spoke again."
Brother Monkey and Friar Sand, who were standing to one side, started spluttering with laughter. The Tang
Priest was angry with Monkey again.
"What are you laughing at?" he asked, and made the hand magic, ready to recite the Band−tightening Spell.
This so terrified Monkey that he fell to his knees at once and said, "I didn't laugh, Master. Whatever you do,
don't say the spell! Don't say it!"
Seeing that master and disciples were getting into a worse and worse temper with each other Mr. Kou gave up
his insistence on their staying. "Don't quarrel, teachers," he said, "I'll definitely see you on your way tomorrow
morning." He then left the sutra hall and told his secretary to write a hundred or so invitations to his neighbors
and relations to see the Tang Priest off to the West early the next morning. He told the cooks to lay on a
parting banquet, while also instructing his steward to have twenty pairs of coloured flags made, hire a band of
musicians, and engage a group of Buddhist monks from the Monastery from the South and another group of
Taoist priests from the Eastern Peak Temple. Everything was to be ready and in order by ten in the morning.
All the gentleman's staff went off to carry out their orders. Soon it was evening again, and after supper
everyone went to bed. It was the time when
Dots of homegoing rooks pass the lonely village;
Drum and bell can be heard from each other's distant towers.
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1345
In streets and markets the bustle is stilled;
In all the houses the lamps shine dimly.
Flowers in the breeze throw shadows under the moon;
The stars shine bright against the Milky Way.
Where the cuckoo sings the night seems deeper;
All natural sounds are stilled across the earth.
During the third and fourth watches of the night all the household servants in charge of various matters got up
early to attend to their tasks. Just watch. The cooks preparing the banquet were busy in the kitchen. The
people who had to buy coloured flags were bustling in front of the hall. Those engaging Buddhist and Taoist
clergy were hurrying about as fast as their legs could carry them. Those hiring musicians were in a great rush.
The messengers delivering invitations ran all over the place, while the servants preparing the carrying−chairs
and horses were calling to each other. They were all shouting from the middle of the night until dawn, and by
around ten o'clock everything was prepared. This was all because the family was rich.
The story tells how the Tang Priest and his disciples got up early to be waited on once more by that crowd of
servants. The venerable elder told them to pack the baggage and saddle the horse. When the idiot heard that
they were about to go he pulled a face, pouted and grumbled, but he still had to pack the clothes and begging
bowls then go to look for the carrying pole. Friar Sand brushed the horse, saddled and harnessed it, and stood
waiting. Brother Monkey put the nine−ringed monastic staff in his master's hand and hung the passport in a
bag in front of his chest. They were now all ready to set out. Mr. Kou then invited them into the large hall at
the back, where a feast was set out that excelled even the one they had eaten in the refectory.
Curtains hung from on high;
Screens stood all around.
In the middle was a picture:
A mountain of long life and a sea of blessings.
On both walls were displayed.
Scrolls of spring, summer, autumn and winter.
From the dragon−patterned tripod came clouds of incense;
Above magpie−tailed burners rose auspicious vapors.
In bowls were bunches of color,
Fresh and brilliant flowers of splendid form.
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1346
The tables were piled with gold:
Lines of confections shaped like lions and immortals.
Music and dancing before the steps were in true harmony;
The dishes in the hall were like a brocade.
Exquisite soup and rice, both free of meat;
The finest tea and the best of wines.
Although they were only commoners
Their home was fine enough for a prince.
All that could be heard were happy sounds
So loud they surprised the sky and shook the earth.
The venerable elder was just exchanging courtesies with Mr. Kou when a servant came in to report, "The
guests are all here." These were the people who had been invited−−neighbors, relations by marriage, and
some of his pious friends who also fed monks and recited the name of the Buddha−−and all of them bowed to
the venerable elder. After the greetings had been made everyone sat down. Outside the hall zithers and
panpipes were played, while inside the hall pipas and songs accompanied the banquet. Pig paid great attention
to this rich banquet.
"Brother," he said to Friar Sand, "relax and eat as much as you can. There won't be anything as good as this to
eat after we leave the Kou house."
"Nonsense," Friar Sand replied with a laugh. "As the saying goes,
No matter how splendid the banquet you eat,
For only a while can it keep you replete.
Your savings may meet the expense of the road,
But savings can never in bellies be stowed."
"You're hopeless," said Pig, "hopeless. If I eat my fill today I won't feel hungry for the next three days."
"Idiot," said Monkey, who had heard this. "Don't fill your belly till it bursts. We've got to start walking now."
They were still talking, and it was almost noon when Sanzang raised his chopsticks and said grace. Pig
grabbed a bowl, filled it with desperate speed, and ate five or six bowlfuls in succession, gulping down a
whole bowlful at a time. Without any qualms at all he filled both his sleeves with steamed bread, twists,
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1347
pancakes and cooked dishes before rising with his master. Sanzang thanked the gentleman and everyone else,
then they all went outside together. Just look at the coloured banners, splendid canopies, drummers and
instrumentalists outside. Only then did two groups of clergy, one Buddhist and one Taoist, arrive.
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Kou, "you are late. Our teacher is in a hurry to leave, so I will not be able to offer you
a meal. I'll show you my gratitude when we come back." Everyone then opened a way to let them through, the
carriers carrying their chairs, the riders on their horses and the walkers on foot all let Sanzang and his three
disciples go first. The heavens rang with drumming and music, the flags and banner blotted out the sun,
crowds pressed around, and carriages and horses were all packed close together as everyone came to watch
Mr. Kou seeing the Tang Priest off. The splendor all around was more magnificent than pearls or jade, and no
less fine than brocade screens behind which spring lies hidden.
The Buddhist monks playing Buddhist tunes and the Taoist priests their Taoist airs all escorted the travelers
out of the prefecture. When they reached the three−mile pavilion, baskets of food and jars of drink were set
out, cups were raised, and they all drank parting toasts.
Mr. Kou, loath to let them go, said as he choked back his tears, "Teacher, you must spend some more days
with us on your way back with the scriptures to fulfil my longing." Overcome with gratitude, Sanzang thanked
him at great length.
"If I reach Vulture Peak," he said, "and see the Lord Buddha the first thing I will do will be to praise your
great virtue. We will certainly come to kowtow to you in thanks on our return journey." As they talked they
covered another mile or so without noticing it. Then the venerable elder insisted on taking his leave, at which
Mr. Kou turned back, sobbing aloud. Indeed:
He who had vowed to feed the clergy found enlightenment:
He was not fated to see the Tathagata Buddha.
We will tell not of how Mr. Kou went home with everyone after seeing the travelers off as far as the
three−mile pavilion, but of how the master and his three disciples went on for some twelve or fifteen miles.
By now it was growing dark.
"It's late," Sanzang said. "Where are we to spend the night?"
Pig, who was carrying the pole, pulled a face and said, "You would have to leave ready−cooked meals behind
and refuse to stay in a nice cool brick house so as to go wherever it is we're going. That's just asking for
trouble. It's very late now. What'll we do if it starts raining?"
"Evil, insolent beast," cursed Sanzang, "complaining again. As the saying goes,
The capital may be remarkably fine,
But we can't linger here for a very long time.
Journey to the West
Chapter 96 1348
If we are fated to visit the Lord Buddha, fetch the true scriptures, go back to Great Tang and report to the
emperor I will let you eat in the imperial kitchens for years on end. Then, you evil beast, you will swell up till
you burst. That will teach you to be such a greedy devil." The idiot chortled quietly to himself, but did not
dare say another word.
When Brother Monkey raised his eyes to look around he saw some buildings beside the road and asked his
master urgently, "Can we spend the night here? Can we?" Sanzang went over to the place, where he saw a
ruined memorial arch on which was inscribed
THE VIHARA OF PADMAPRABHA
"The Bodhisattva Padmaprabha was a disciple of the Buddha Sikhin," said Sanzang, dismounting. "He was
dismissed for eliminating the Demon King of Poison Fire and turned into the Spirit Officer of the Five
Manifests. There must be a shrine here." They then all went in together. The cloisters had all collapsed, the
walls had fallen down, and there was no trace of anybody around, only of vegetation running wild. They
would have gone out again, but the sky had filled with dark clouds and it had started to pour with rain. There
was nothing for it but to find a place in the ruins where they could shelter from the storm. They kept
completely silent, not daring to speak aloud for fear that some evil demon might hear them. Thus it was that
they endured a sleepless night sitting or standing there. Oh dear! How true it is that
Disaster strikes at triumph's height;
In time of joy comes sorrow's blight.
If you don't know what happened when they carried on with their journey, listen to the explanation in the next
installment.
Chapter 97
The Monks and Their Supporters Meet With Demonic Attack
The Sage Makes the Spirit Reappear to Save the Primal One
We will tell not of how the Tang Priest and the others endured a hard night in the dilapidated palace of
Padmaprabha, but of a group of evil villains in Diling county in the prefecture of Brazentower who had
squandered all their families' fortunes in whoring, drinking and gambling. Having nothing else left to live on
they had formed a criminal gang of a dozen and more members and were discussing which family was the
richest in the city and which the second richest. The idea was to rob them of their gold and silver and thus get
some money to spend.
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1349
"There's no need to go round making enquiries," one of them said, "or work it out in detail. The Mr. Kou who
saw the Tang monk off today is rolling in money. Let's strike tonight in the rain. There'll be nobody ready for
us in the streets and the fire wardens won't be patrolling. When we've stolen his property we'll be able to go
with the girls, gamble and have a good time again. That would be great, wouldn't it?"
The other robbers were all delighted with the suggestion, and with one heart they all set out in the rain
carrying daggers, spiked clubs, sticks, coshes, ropes and torches. Flinging open the main gates of the Kou
house they charged inside, shouting and sending everyone inside, young and old, male and female, scurrying
into hiding. The old woman hid under the bed and the old man slipped behind the gates, while Kou Liang,
Kou Dong and their families fled for their lives in all directions. Holding their knives in their hands and
lighting torches, the bandits opened up all the chests in the house and grabbed as much of the gold, silver,
jewelry, hair ornaments, clothing, vessels and other household goods as they wanted. Mr. Kou could not bear
to lose all this, so taking his life in his hands he come out from behind the gate to plead with the robbers.
"Take as much as you want, great kings," he said, "but please leave me a few clothes to be buried in." The
robbers were in no mood for argument. They rushed up to him, tripped and kicked him to the ground. Alas,
His three souls vanished to the underworld;
His seven spirits left the world of men.
The successful robbers left the Kou house, put up a rope ladder from the foot of the city wall, took it in turns
to cross and fled Westwards in the rain. Only when they saw that the robbers had gone did the servants of the
Kou family dare show their heads again. When they looked for old Mr. Kou and found him lying dead on the
floor they started weeping aloud. "Heavens! The master's been murdered!" they all said as they wept,
embracing the body and sobbing in misery.
When it was almost the fourth watch the resentful Mrs. Kou, who was angry with the Tang Priest and his
followers for rejecting their hospitality, and also because the extravagance of their send−off had provoked this
disaster, decided to ruin the four of them. Helping Kou Liang to his feet, she said, "Don't cry, my son. Your
father fed monks day in and day out. Who ever would have thought that he would complete the number by
feeding a gang of monks who'd murder him?"
"Mother," the brothers asked, "how did those monks murder him?"
"Those bandits were so bold and vicious that when they charged in I hid under the bed," she replied.
"Although I was trembling I made sure to take a very good look at them by the light of the torches. Do you
know who they were? The Tang Priest was lighting torches, Pig was holding a knife, Friar Sand was taking
the gold and silver, and Monkey killed your father." The two sons believed all this.
"If you saw all that clearly, mother," they said, "you must be right. They spent a fortnight in our house, so
they knew all the doors, walls, windows and passageways. They must have been tempted by our wealth and
come back here under cover of rain and darkness. How evil! They've stolen our property and murdered our
father. Once it's light we'll go to the local government and report them as wanted men."
"What sort of wanted notice should we write?" Kou Dong asked.
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1350
"We'll write what our mother said," Kou Liang replied, and he wrote:
The Tang Priest lit the torches, Pig incited to murder, Friar Sand stole the gold and silver and Sun the Novice
murdered our father.
The whole household was in such a hubbub that before they noticed it day had dawned. While invitations
were sent out to their relatives and a coffin was ordered Kou Liang and his brother went to the local
government offices to deposit their complaint. Now the prefect of Brazentower:
Had always been upright,
Was good by nature.
As a boy he had studied by the light of the snow;
When young he had taken the palace examinations.
His heart was always set on loyalty and justice,
And filled with thoughts of kindness and benevolence.
His name would be transmitted in annals for a thousand years,
Like a Gong Sui or Huang Ba come back to life;
His fame would resound for ten thousand ages in the balls of office,
Zhuo Mao and Lu Gong reborn.
When he had taken his seat in the hall and declared that all matters could be dealt with, he ordered that the
placard asking for plaints should be carried outside. Kou Liang and his brother then came in holding the
placard, knelt down and called aloud, "Your Honour, we have come to denounce some bandits as thieves and
murderers." The prefect accepted their complaint and read what it had to say.
"I was told yesterday that your family completed your vow of feeding monks," the prefect said, "by feeding
four distinguished ones, arhats from the Tang Dynasty in the East. You made a great display of sending them
off with drums and music. So how could such a thing as this have possibly happened?"
"Your Honour," said Kou Liang, kowtowing, "our father Kou Hong had been feeding monks for twenty−four
years. These four monks who had come from afar just happened to make up the ten thousand, which was why
he held a service to mark the completion and kept them there for a fortnight. They got to know all the
passageways, doors and windows. They were seen off during the day and came back yesterday evening.
During the dark and stormy night they charged into the house with torches and weapons to steal our gold,
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1351
silver, jewelry, clothes and hair ornaments. They beat our father to death and left him lying on the ground. We
beg you to be our protector." On hearing this the prefect mustered infantry, cavalry and able−bodied civilian
conscripts, 150 men in all, who rushed straight out of the Western gate carrying sharp weapons in pursuit of
the Tang Priest and his three disciples.
The story now tells how master and disciples stayed in the ruins of the minor palace of padmaprabha until
dawn, when they went out and started hurrying Westwards. The bandits, who had gone along the main road
West all night till daybreak after robbing the Kou family and leaving the city, had passed the palace of
Padmaprabha and hidden in the mountains some six or seven miles to the West. Here they were just dividing
up the gold and silver when the Tang Priest and his three followers came into view, also heading West along
the road.
The bandits, whose greed was not yet sated, pointed at the Tang Priest and said, "Look! Aren't they the monks
who were seen off yesterday?"
"And a very welcome arrival too," said the other bandits, laughing, "Let's do a bit more of our dirty business.
Those monks coming along the road spent a long time in the Kou house. Goodness only knows how much
stuff they're carrying. Let's hold them up, take their travel money and white horse, and share it all out. That'll
suit us very nicely." The robbers then rushed to the road, brandishing their weapons and yelling their war cry
as they formed a line.
"Stay where you are, monks," they shouted. "Leave some toll money and we'll spare your lives. If so much as
half a 'no' comes out through your teeth you'll all be cut down without mercy." The Tang Priest was shaking
with terror as he sat on his horse.
"What are we to do?" Pig and Friar Sand asked Brother Monkey with alarm. "What are we to do? We had a
miserable night in the rain, and after starting out again this morning we're being robbed by bandits. How true
is it that troubles never come singly."
"Don't be frightened, Master," said Monkey with a smile, "and stop worrying, brothers. Wait while I go and
ask them a few questions."
The splendid Great Sage put on his tigerskin kilt, straightened up his brocade and cotton tunic, went up to
them, put his hands together in front of his chest and asked, "What are you gentlemen doing?"
"Don't you care whether you live or die, you swine?" the robbers yelled back at him. "How dare you question
us! Have you got no eyes in your head? Don't you realize who we great kings are? Hand your toll money over
at once and we'll let you go on your way."
When he heard this, Monkey wreathed his face in smiles and replied, "So you're bandits who hold people up
on the road."
"Kill him!" the bandits yelled with fury.
"Your Majesties," said Monkey with feigned terror, "Your Majesties, I'm only a monk from the country. I
don't know the right things to say. Please don't be angry if I've offended you, please don't. If what you want is
toll money all you have to do is to ask me: no need to ask the other three. I'm the bookkeeper. All the money
we get for chanting sutras and as alms, all we beg and all we're given, goes into the bundles, and I'm in charge
of spending it. The man on the horse is my master. All he can do is recite sutras. He doesn't care about
Journey to the West

anything else. He's forgotten all about wealth and sex, and he's got nothing at all. The black−faced one is a
junior I collected on our journey. All he can do is look after the horse. And the one with a long snout is a
laborer I hired. He's only good for carrying a pole. Let those three go while I fetch our travel money, cassocks
and begging bowls. I'll give you all you want."
"You seem to be an honest chap, monk," the robbers said, "so we'll spare your life. Tell the other three to
leave their luggage, and we'll let them go." Monkey turned back and gave them a look. Friar Sand put down
the carrying−pole with the luggage, and led the master's horse as they carried on Westwards. Monkey bowed
down to undo the bundle, took a pinch of dust from the ground, and scattered it on the bundle as he said the
words of a spell.
It was body−fixing magic, so the moment he shouted, "Stop!" the thirty and more bandits all stood stock still,
grinding their teeth, staring, their hands apart. None of them could speak or move.
"Come back, Master," shouted Monkey, "come back!"
"This is terrible," said Pig in alarm, "this is terrible. Big brother's informed on us. He isn't carrying any money
on him, and there's no gold or silver in the bundle. He must be calling the master back to ask him to give up
his horse. He's going to get the clothes stripped off our backs."
"Don't talk such rubbish, brother," said Friar Sand with a laugh. "Big brother knows what he's doing. He's
always been able to beat vicious monsters and demons up till now, so what do we have to fear from a few
petty thieves? He must be calling us back because he's got something to say to us. Let's go straight there and
find out."
When the venerable elder heard this he cheerfully turned his horse round and went back. "Wukong," he called,
"why have you called us back?"
"Hear what these robbers have got to say for themselves," Brother Monkey said.
Pig went up to them, shoved them and asked, "Why don't you move, bandits?" The bandits remained
completely unconscious and said nothing.
"They're thick, and dumb too," said Pig.
"I fixed them by magic," said Monkey with a laugh.
"Even if you fixed them," said Pig, "you didn't fix their mouths, so why aren't they making a sound?"
"Please dismount and sit down, Master," said Brother Monkey. "As the saying goes, 'People only get arrested
by mistake; they never get released by mistake.' Knock all the robbers over, brother, and tie them up. Then
we'll force them to make statements. Find out if they're beginners or old hands."
"Haven't got any rope," said Friar Sand. Monkey then pulled out some of his hairs, blew on them with magic
breath and turned them into thirty lengths of rope. They all set to, knocked the robbers over, and tied their
hands and feet together. Then Monkey said the words that ended the spell, whereupon the bandits gradually
revived.
Monkey invited the Tang Priest to take the seat of honour while he and the other two shouted, holding their
weapons, "Hairy bandits! How many of you are there altogether, and how many years have you been in this
line of business? How many things have you stolen? Have you murdered anyone? Is this your first offence?
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1353
Or your second? Or your third?"
"Spare our lives, your lordships," pleaded the robbers.
"Stop shouting," said Monkey, "and come clean."
"We aren't hardened robbers, your lordships," they said. "We're all from good families. Because we're a bad
lot we squandered all the wealth we'd inherited in drinking, gambling, whoring and living it up. We've never
worked, and now we've got no money either. We found out that Mr. Kou's family was one of the richest in the
prefecture of Brazentower, so last night we got together to rob it under cover of darkness and rain. We stole
some gold, silver, clothing and jewelry, and were just dividing it up in a mountain hollow to the North of the
track when we noticed you gentlemen coming. Some of us recognized you as the monks Mr. Kou saw off, so
we were sure that you must have some goods on you. Then we saw how heavy your luggage was and how fast
the white horse was going. It was our disgraceful greed that made us try to hold you up. Never did we imagine
that you would have such divine powers and be able to tie us up. We beg you to be merciful to us. Take back
what we stole and spare our lives."
Sanzang was violently shocked to hear that their booty had been stolen from the Kou household. He stood up
at once and said, "Mr. Kou was a very good man, Wukong, so how did he bring such a disaster on himself?"
"It was all because the coloured hangings and fancy parasols, and the huge numbers of drummers and
musicians when we were seen off attracted too much attention," replied Monkey with a smile. "That's why
this gang of desperadoes attacked his house. Luckily they ran into us, and we've taken back all the gold, silver,
clothing and jewelry."
"We put Mr. Kou out for a whole fortnight," said Sanzang, "so we owe him a huge debt of gratitude that we
have not yet been able to repay. Would it not be a good deed to return this property to his house?" Monkey
agreed, and he went to the mountain hollow with Pig and Friar Sand to fetch the booty, which they packed up
and loaded on the horse. He told Pig to carry the load of gold and silver while friar Sand carried their own
luggage. Monkey was just on the point of killing all the bandits with his cudgel when he had the worrying
thought that the Tang Priest might get angry with him for committing murder. So he could only shake himself
and take back all the hairs. Now that their hands and feet had been untied the thieves all got up then fled for
their lives into the undergrowth. The Tang Priest then turned back the way he had come to return the booty to
Mr. Kou. In making this journey he was like a moth flying into a flame and coming to disaster. There is a
poem about it that goes:
Kindness to others is rarely with kindness rewarded;
Kindness will often to hate and hostility lead.
Plunge in the water to rescue the drowning? You'll suffer.
Think before acting and spare yourself grief you don't need.
Sanzang and his disciples were just heading back with the gold, silver, clothing and jewelry when the crowd
of men armed with spears and swords arrived. "Disciples," said Sanzang with alarm, "look at all those armed
men coming here. What is happening?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1354
"It's a disaster," said Pig, "a disaster. They're the robbers we set free. They've found weapons and ganged up
with some more people. Now they've come back and they're going to kill us."
"They don't look like bandits, brother," said Friar Sand. "Big brother, take a closer look."
"The master's in bad trouble again," Monkey whispered to Friar Sand. "These must be soldiers here to capture
the bandits." Before he had finished saying this the soldiers were upon the master and his disciples,
surrounding them.
"You're a fine bunch of monks," they said, "robbing a house then swaggering around here like this." They
then rushed them, dragged the Tang Priest off his horse and tied him up. Next they tied up Brother Monkey
and the others, and carried them off hanging from poles, two men to each of them. Driving the horse along
and seizing the baggage, they went back to the prefectural city. This is what could be seen:
The Tang Priest,
Shivering and shaking,
Weeping and lost for words.
Zhu Bajie,
Muttering and grumbling,
Full of complaints.
Friar Sand,
Talking away,
While secretly feeling uncertain.
Sun the Novice,
Chuckling merrily,
Ready to use his powers.
Hustled and carried along by the soldiers, they were soon back in the city, where the soldiers escorted them
straight to the prefect's court.
"Your Honour," they reported, "the constables have captured the robbers and brought them back." The prefect,
sitting in his place in the court, rewarded the constables, inspected the booty and sent for the Kou family to
collect it. Then he had Sanzang and the others brought into court.
"You monks maintain that you come from a place far away to the East and are going to worship the Buddha in
the Western Heaven," he said, interrogating them. "But really you're housebreakers who used dirty tricks so
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1355
that you could get to know your way around."
"Your Honour," Sanzang replied, "we are not robbers. I would not dare to deceive you. We carry a passport
with us as proof. It was because we were so grateful to Mr. Kou's family for feeding us for a fortnight that
when we ran into the robbers along our way we recovered the booty they had stolen from the Kou house. We
were taking it back to the Kou house to pay our debt of gratitude when to our astonishment we were arrested
as robbers by the constables. We really are not robbers, and I beg Your Honour to investigate closely."
"You only made up that fancy talk about paying a debt of gratitude because you were arrested by the
soldiers," the prefect replied. "If you really met other robbers why didn't you show your gratitude by capturing
them and turning them in? Why are only the four of you here? Look at the wanted notice Kou Liang
submitted. He accuses you by name. How dare you still dispute it!" When Sanzang heard this he felt like a
storm−tossed boat on the ocean, and all his souls flew away.
"Wukong," he said, "why don't you come forward and argue in our defense?"
"The booty proves it," said Monkey. "Arguing would do no good."
"That's right," the prefect said. "The booty is all here as proof. Do you still dare to deny it? Fetch the
head−clamp," he instructed his underlings, "and put it round the head of the bald robber. Then beat him
again."
Monkey was now very anxious. "Even though my master is fated to suffer this," he thought to himself, "I
mustn't let it be too tough for him." Seeing the yamen runners tightening the cord to fix the head−clamp in
place he opened his mouth to speak.
"Please don't squeeze that monk's head, Your Honour. When we robbed the Kou house last night I was the
one who lit the torches, carried the sword, stole the goods and killed the man. I was the ringleader. If you want
to torture anyone, torture me. It's nothing to do with them. The only thing is that you mustn't let me go."
On hearing this the prefect ordered, "Put the clamp on him first." The underlings then all fell on Monkey,
fixed the clamp on his head, and tightened it so hard that the cord snapped with a twang. The clamp was
fastened, tightened and snapped with a twang again. They did this three or four times, and the skin on his head
was not even creased.
When they changed the cord and were tightening it again someone was heard coming in to report, "Your
Honour, the Lord Assistant Protector Chen from the capital is coming. Will you please come to greet him
outside the city?"
The prefect then ordered the head torturer, "Throw the bandits into gaol and keep a good eye on them. The
torture and interrogation will continue after I have gone to greet my superior." The head torturer then marched
the Tang Priest and the other three into the gaol. Pig and Friar Sand carried their luggage in with them.
"Disciple," said Sanzang, "what are we to do?"
"In you go, Master," said Monkey with a grin, "in you go. There aren't any dogs barking in there. It'll be a
lark." The four of them were then taken inside, and each of them was pushed on a torture rack, to which their
bellies, heads and chests were tightly fastened. The warders then started beating them up again.
Finding the agony unbearable, Sanzang called out, "Whatever shall I do, Wukong? Whatever shall I do?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1356
"They're beating us because they want money," Brother Monkey replied. "As the saying goes,
Stay put when things are going well;
Spend cash when things are going ill.
They'll stop if you give them some money."
"But where am I to get money from?" Sanzang asked.
"If you haven't any money," Monkey replied, "clothes will do. Give them the cassock."
These words cut Sanzang to the heart, but realizing that the beating was more than he could take he could only
say, "Do as you will, Wukong."
"Gentlemen," Monkey called out, "there's no need to beat us any more. There's a brocade cassock in one of
the two bundles we brought in with us that's worth a fortune. Open them up and take it." When the warders
heard this they all set to together, opening the bundles up to search them. There were some cotton clothes and
a document case, but none of these were worth anything. Seeing something glowing brightly inside several
layers of oiled paper the warders realized that it must be a treasure. When they shook it open and looked at it,
this is what it looked like:
Exquisitely decorated with shining pearls,
Set with some wonderful Buddha treasures.
Embroidered dragons curled around;
Flying phoenixes adorned brocade edges.
As they all struggled to look they disturbed the head gaoler, who came up to them and shouted, "What are you
all making this row about?"
Falling to their knees, the warders replied, "His Honour has just started a case against four monks and sent
them here. When we roughed them up a bit they gave us these two bundles. After we opened them we saw
this, and we don't know how to deal with it. It would be a real pity to tear it up to divide between us, but it
would be hard on everyone else if just one of us had it. It's a good thing you've come, sir: you can give us a
ruling." The head gaoler could see that it was a cassock. Then he inspected the other clothes and the document
case, and on opening the case to read the passport he saw that it was covered with seals and signatures from
many states.
"It's a good thing I saw this in time," he said. "If I hadn't, you people would have caused bad trouble. These
monks aren't robbers. On no account touch their things. When His Honour questions them again tomorrow
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1357
we'll find out the truth." The warders then gave the wrapping cloths back to the prisoners, who repacked them
and handed them over to the head gaoler for safekeeping.
Evening was slowly drawing in. The drum could be heard from its tower, and the fire wardens began their
patrols. By the third mark of the fourth watch Monkey could see that the others had stopped groaning and
were fast asleep. "The master was fated to meet with the hardship of a night in gaol," he thought. "That was
why I said nothing in our defense and didn't use my magic powers. But now the fourth watch is nearly over,
and his suffering's almost done. I'd better start getting things sorted out if we're to leave this gaol at dawn."
Just watch as he uses his powers to make himself smaller, get off the rack, shake himself and turn into a
midge who flies out of the prison through a gap between the tiles over the eaves. By the light of the stars and
the moon in the still, silent night sky, he could see where he was going, and he flew quietly straight towards
the gates of the Kou house. On the West side of the road was a house where a lamp was shining brightly, and
as he flew closer for a better look he saw that it was a house of beancurd−makers. An old man could be seen
looking after the fire while an old woman was squeezing out the bean juice.
"Wife," the old man suddenly called out, "Mr. Kou had wealth and sons, but he didn't live long. When we
were boys we were both at school together. I was five years older than him. His father was called Kou Ming.
In those days he had less than 150 acres. He couldn't even collect his overdue rents. Old Kou Ming died when
his son was nineteen, and once the young man took charge of the household things went really well. He
married the daughter of Zhang Wang−−she used to be known as Threadneedle when she was a girl, but she
made her husband a rich man. Once she came into his house his crops were good and the debts to him got
paid. Whatever he bought showed a profit, and whatever he went in for made money. His family's worth a
hundred thousand now. When he reached forty he turned pious and he fed ten thousand monks. Fancy him
being kicked to death by robbers last night! Poor man. He was only sixty−four. Who would have thought so
good a man would meet with so evil a reward and be murdered just when everything was going well for him?
What a pity! What a pity!"
By the time Monkey had listened to all this it was now at the first mark of the fifth watch. He then flew into
the Kou house, where a coffin was placed in the main room. A lamp was burning at the head, and around the
coffin was incense, candles and fruit. His wife was weeping beside him, and the two sons also came to
kowtow and weep, while their wives brought two bowls of rice as an offering. Monkey landed at the head of
the coffin and coughed. This gave the two daughters−in−law such a fright that they ran outside waving their
arms about.
Kou Liang and his brother lay on the floor, too terrified to move, and crying out, "Oh, father, oh!" Their
mother, being bolder, hit the head of the coffin and said, "Have you come back to life, old man?"
"No," replied Monkey, imitating Mr. Kou's voice, to the great alarm of the two sons, who kept kowtowing,
weeping, and repeating, "Oh, Father, oh!"
Their mother summoned up even more courage to ask, "Husband, if you haven't come back to life why are
you talking?"
"King Yama has sent demons to bring me here to talk to you," Monkey replied. "He told me that
Threadneedle Zhang had been lying and trying to frame the innocent."
In her surprise at hearing him call her by the name she had been known as a child, the old woman fell at once
to her knees, kowtowed and said, "You're a fine old man! Fancy calling me by my childhood name at this age!
What lies have I been telling? Which innocent people have I framed?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1358
"Wasn't there something about 'The Tang Priest lit the torches, Pig incited to murder, Friar Sand stole the gold
and silver, and Sun the Novice murdered our father?'" Monkey replied. "Your lies have landed those good
men in terrible trouble. What really happened was that the Tang Priest and the other three teachers met some
bandits and got our property back for us to show their thanks. How good of them! But you had to concoct a
wanted notice and send our sons to denounce them to the authorities. The court threw them in gaol without
making a careful investigation. The gaol god, the local deity and the city god were all so alarmed and uneasy
that they reported it to King Yama, and he ordered demons to escort me back home. I'm to tell you to have
them released as soon as possible. If you don't, I will have to make havoc here for a month. Nobody in the
household, young or old−−not even the dogs and the chickens−−will be spared."
Kou Liang and his brother kowtowed again and begged, "Please go back, Father, and don't harm us all. At
dawn we'll submit a petition to the court for their release and withdraw our charge against them. We only
want peace for both the living and the dead."
When Monkey heard this he called out, "Burn sacrificial paper money. I am leaving." All his family started
burning paper money. Monkey then rose up on his wings and flew straight to the prefect's residence. Bending
low to look he saw that there was a light in the bedroom: the prefect was already up. When Monkey flew into
the main room, he saw a scroll−painting hanging on the back wall. It showed an official riding a piebald horse
with several servants holding a blue umbrella and carrying a folding chair. Monkey did not know what the
picture was about, but landed in the middle of it. All of a sudden the prefect came out of the bedroom and bent
low to comb and wash himself. Monkey gave a sharp cough, alarming the prefect and sending him hurrying
back into his bedroom. When he had combed his hair, washed himself and put on his formal clothes the
prefect came out to burn incense to the picture and pray to it.
"Venerable uncle, divine Jiang Qianyi, your dutiful nephew Jiang Kunsan is now prefect of Brazentower,
thanks to the hereditary privilege won for me by your ancestral virtue, and also to my success in the
examinations. Morning and evening I offer incense without interruption. Why did you speak today? I beg you
not to haunt us and terrify the household."
"So this is a holy picture of his ancestor," Brother Monkey thought with a hidden smile, and making the most
of this chance he called out, "Nephew Kunsan, you have always been uncorrupt in the office you were given
through ancestral privilege. How could you have been so stupid yesterday? You took four holy monks for
thieves and threw them into prison without finding out why they had come. The prison god, the local deity
and the city god were all so disturbed by this that they reported it to the king of Hell. He told demon envoys to
bring me here to speak to you and advise you to consider the circumstances and find out the truth, and release
them at once. Otherwise you'll have to come back to the Underworld with me for the case to be sorted out."
When the prefect heard this he replied in terror, "Please go back now, sit. Your nephew will go straight into
court and release them at once."
"Very well then," Monkey said. "Burn some sacrificial paper money. I am going to report back to King
Yama." The prefect lit incense, burned paper money and bowed in thanks. When Monkey flew out again and
looked around he saw that the East was already turning white. He then flew to the Diling county office, where
all the county officials could be seen in the courtroom.
"If I talk when I'm a midge," he thought, "and someone spots me it'll give the game away. That wouldn't do."
So he gave himself a giant magical body where he was in mid air, and stretched down one foot that filled the
whole courtroom. "Listen to me, you officials," he shouted. "I am the Roving God Rambler, sent here by the
Jade Emperor. He says that sons of the Buddha on their way to fetch the scriptures have been beaten up in the
prefectural gaol here, which has disturbed the gods of the three worlds. He has asked me to tell you to release
them at once. If anything goes wrong I'm to use my other foot to kick all you county and prefecture officials
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1359
to death, then crush all the people around here and trample the whole city to dust and ashes." At this the
county magistrate and the other officials all fell to their knees and kowtowed in worship.
"Please go back now, superior sage," they pleaded. "We are now going to the prefectural offices to request His
Honour to release them immediately. We implore you not to move your feet and terrify us to death." Only
then did Monkey put away that magical body, turn into a midge again and fly back into the gaol through a gap
between the tiles at the eaves, climb into his rack and go to sleep.
The story now tells that no sooner had the prefect entered his courtroom and ordered the notice inviting people
to submit written requests to be carried outside than Kou Liang and his brother fell to their knees at the
entrance, holding the notice in their arms. The prefect ordered them to come in, and when the prefect read the
document that the two of them submitted he said in fury, "Yesterday you handed me a wanted notice. The
thieves were arrested and you had the booty back. So why are you asking for them to be released today?"
"Your Honour," the two brothers replied, tears streaming down, "last night our father's spirit appeared to us
and said 'the holy monks from Tang captured the bandits, took our property back from them, released them
and were kindly bringing the goods back to us to show their gratitude. How could you have treated them as
robbers, captured them and made them suffer in gaol? The local god in the gaol and the city god were so
alarmed and uneasy that they reported it to King Yama. King Yama ordered demons to escort me back to tell
you to go to the prefectural court and submit another plea for the Tang Priest's release and thus avoid disaster.
Otherwise everybody in the household would be killed.' This is why we have come with this request for their
release. We beg you to help us, Your Honour."
On hearing this the prefect thought, "Their father is a new ghost whose body is still warm, so it's not
surprising that he should have appeared to them after what happened. But my uncle has been dead for five or
six years. Why did he appear to me early this morning and tell me to investigate and release them? It really
does look as though an injustice has been done."
As the prefect was thinking things over the magistrate and other officials of Diling county came rushing into
the courtroom to say in a wild panic, "Disaster, Your Honour, disaster! The Jade Emperor has just sent the
Roving God Rambler down to earth to tell you to release those good men from gaol this very moment. The
monks captured yesterday weren't robbers: they are disciples of the Buddha going to fetch the scriptures. If
there's any delay he's going to kick all us officials to death, then trample the whole city and all the people in it
to dust and ashes." The prefect turned pale at this new shock, then told the head gaoler to write a release order
and deliver them to the court. The prison doors were immediately opened and they were led out.
"Goodness knows what sort of beating we're in for today," said Pig gloomily.
"I can guarantee that they won't dare give you a single clout," said Monkey with a grin. "I've fixed everything
up. When you go into the courtroom you absolutely mustn't kneel. He'll come down into the court to invite us
to take the best seats. Then we'll ask for our luggage and the horse back from him. If anything's missing I'll
give him a beating for your entertainment."
Before he had finished speaking they reached the entrance to the courtroom, where the prefect, the county
magistrate and all the other officials came out to welcome them with the words, "When you holy monks
arrived yesterday we were under urgent pressure to meet our superiors. In addition, we did see the stolen
goods. That is why we did not find out the truth." The Tang Priest put his hands together in front of his chest,
bowed and recounted in detail everything that had happened.
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1360
The officials were all voluble in admitting, "We were wrong, we were wrong. Please, please don't be angry
with us."
They then asked if the monks had lost anything in the prison. Monkey stepped forward, opened his eyes wide
in a glare and yelled at the top of his voice, "Our white horse was taken by the court officers, and the gaolers
took our luggage. Give it back right now. It's our turn to torture and question you lot how. What should the
punishment for wrongfully arresting innocent people as bandits be?"
Seeing how ugly he was acting, the prefectural and county officials were all terrified. They told the people
who had taken the horse to return the horse, and the men who had taken the luggage to return every single
piece of it. Just look at how viciously the three disciples start acting, while the officials could only blame the
Kou family to cover up their own blunder.
"Disciples," said Sanzang, trying to calm them down. "Let us go to the Kou house to question them and argue
it out with them in order to make everything clear. Then we can find out who it was who took us for robbers."
"Good idea," said Brother Monkey. "I'll call the dead man back and ask him who killed him."
Friar Sand hoisted the Tang Priest up on the horse right there in the courtroom, then escorted him outside with
much shouting. All the prefectural and county officials accompanied them to the Kou house, so alarming Kou
Liang and his brother that they kowtowed repeatedly in front of the gateway then led them into the hall. This
was where old Mr. Kou's coffin lay, and the whole family was to be seen weeping inside the mourning drapes
around it.
"Stop howling, you lying old woman," Monkey shouted. "You tried to get innocent men killed. Wait till I call
your husband back. We'll see what he has to say about who murdered him. That'll shame her." The officials all
thought that Monkey was joking, but then he said, "Please keep my master company for a moment, Your
Honors, Pig, Friar Sand, protect him well. I'm off. I'll soon be back."
The splendid Great Sage bounded outside and rose up into the sky.
Coloured clouds were all around to cover up the house.
Auspicious auras filled the sky to protect the primal deity.
Only then did everyone recognize that Monkey was an immortal who could ride clouds and mists, and a sage
who could bring the dead back to life. We will not tell of how they all burned incense and worshipped.
The Great Sage went straight to the Underworld by somersault cloud and charged into the Senluo Palace,
causing such alarm that:
The Ten Kings of the Underworld came out to raise their bands in greeting;
The demon judges of the five regions kowtowed in welcome.
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1361
A thousand trees of knives all leaned away;
Ten thousand hills of swords all leveled themselves.
In the City of the Unjustly Slain the fiends were converted;
Under the bridge over Punishment River the dead return to life.
The divine light was like the grace of Heaven,
And everywhere shone bright in the palaces of darkness.
The Ten Kings received the Great Sage, greeted him, and asked him why he had come. "Who's got the ghost
of Kou Hong who used to feed monks in Diling County in the prefecture of Brazentower?" said Monkey.
"Find him and give him to me at once."
"Kou Hong is a very good man," the Ten King replied. "He came here himself. No demon had to envoys drag
him here with their hooks. He met King Ksitigarbha's Goldenclad Boy, who took him to see Ksitigarbha."
Monkey then took his leave of them and went straight to the Turquoise Cloud Palace, where he saw the
Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha. When the Bodhisattva had greeted him Monkey explained what had happened.
"Liang Hong's allotted span had been completed," the Bodhisattva said with delight, "and his life was over.
That is why he left the world behind and came here without touching his bed. As he was such a good man
who had fed monks I have made him a chief recorder in charge of the register of good deeds. But since you
have come here to fetch him, Great Sage, I shall grant him a twelve−year extension of his life on earth. Let
him leave with the Great Sage."
The Goldenclad Boy then led out Kou Hong, who on seeing Monkey kept saying, "Teacher, save me!
Teacher!"
"You were kicked to death by robbers," said Monkey, "and now you're in the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha's
place in the Under world. I've come to fetch you and take you to the world of the living to sort this matter out.
The Bodhisattva will let you go back and has given you another twelve years of life, after which you'll come
back here." The old gentleman kowtowed to him endlessly.
Having thanked and taken his leave of the Bodhisattva, Monkey blew on Kou Hong, turned him into vapor,
tucked him into his sleeve and left the Underworld to go back to the world of the living. He rode his cloud
back to the Kou house, told Pig to lever the lid off the coffin and pushed Kou Hong's spirit back into the body.
A moment later Kou Hong started breathing as he came back to life. Climbing out of his coffin, he kowtowed
to the Tang Priest and his three disciples with the words, "Teachers, teachers, I was wrongly killed, but my
master went to the Underworld to bring me back to life. I owe him my recovery."
His thanks were unending. When he turned round and saw all the officials drawn up in line he kowtowed
again and asked, "Why are all your lordships in my house?"
"Your sons first submitted a wanted notice," the prefect replied, "and accused the holy monks by name. I sent
men to arrest them, not realizing that the holy monks had met the robbers who raided your house, taken the
booty off them and were returning it to your house. I was wrong to have them arrested, and I had them thrown
Journey to the West
Chapter 97 1362
into gaol without making a detailed investigation. Last night your spirit appeared, my late uncle came to lodge
a complaint with me, and the Roving God Rambler came down to earth in the county offices. After so many
manifestations I released the holy monks, and they have brought you back to life."
"Your Honour," said Mr. Kou on his knees, "these four holy monks really have been wronged. That night over
thirty bandits with torches and weapons robbed my house. Because I could not bear to lose all those things I
tried to reason with the robbers, but to my horror they kicked me to death. What's it got to do with these four
gentlemen?"
He then called for his wife. "Why did you people make that lying report about who had killed me? Will you
please determine their punishments, Your Honour." Everyone in the family, young and old alike, kowtowed.
In his magnanimity the prefect spared them from punishment. Kou Hong then ordered a banquet to thank the
prefectural and county officials for their generosity. The officials all returned to their offices without sitting
down at the banquet. The next day the sign announcing that monks would be fed was hung out again, and
another attempt was made to keep Sanzang there. Sanzang refused absolutely to stay any longer. Once again
Mr. Kou invited his friends and relations, arranged for flags and canopies and saw them off as before. Indeed:
However remote the place evil deeds can be done;
Heaven may be high, but it does not desert the good.
Steadily they plod along towards the Tathagata
Until they reach the gate of bliss on Vulture Peak.
If you do not know what happened when they met the Buddha, listen to the explanation in the next
installment.
Chapter 98
When the Ape and the Horse Are Tamed They Cast Off Their Husks
When All the Deeds Have Been Done Reality Is Seen
The story told how after coming back to life Mr. Kou once more arranged for parasols, banners, drummers,
musicians, Buddhist monks, Taoist priests, his friends and his relations to see Sanzang off again. But instead
of describing this we will tell of the Tang Priest and his three disciples taking the main road. The West was
indeed a land of the Buddha, unlike anywhere else. They saw precious flowers, rare grasses, ancient cypresses
and hoary pines. In all the places they passed through every family was pious and fed monks. Under every
mountain people cultivated their conduct; in all the forests travelers recited sutras Master and disciples took
shelter each night and set out at dawn, till six or seven days later a mass of high buildings and splendid halls
suddenly came into view. Truly they were:
Thrusting a hundred feet into the heavens,
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1363
Touching the Milky Way in the sky.
Lower your head and see the setting sun;
Put out your hand and pluck a shooting star.
The spacious windows enclose the cosmos;
The towering roofbeams join up with the clouds.
Yellow cranes bring letters as the autumn trees grow old;
Coloured phoenix epistles come in the fresh evening breeze.
These are sacred and precious palaces and gates,
Jeweled, intricate buildings and courtyards.
In the holy halls the Way is discussed;
Sutras are transmitted throughout the universe.
The flowers are beautiful as they turn towards the spring;
Green are the pine trees in the rain.
Purple fungus and immortals' fruits ever flourish;
All beings respond as red phoenixes soar.
Sanzang raised his whip and pointed with it as he said, "What a fine place, Wukong."
"Master," said Monkey, "when you were in those delusive places where you saw false images of Buddhas you
insisted on prostrating yourself in front of them. But today, when you've reached the real place where there is
the true image of the Buddha, you won't even dismount. What do you mean by it?" No sooner did he hear this
than Sanzang sprang straight out of the saddle and went to the gateway.
A young lay brother who stood to one side of the monastery gateway called out, "You must be the people
from the East who have come to fetch the scriptures." The venerable elder quickly straightened his clothes and
raised his head to look around. He saw that the boy was
Wearing clothes of golden brocade,
Waving a jade−handled whisk.
Wearing clothes of golden brocade
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1364
He feasted in pavilions by the Jasper Pool;
Waving a jade−handled whisk
He dusted the steps of the purple palaces.
At his side hung an immortal's tablet;
And on his feet were sandals.
He was a true winged adept,
Elegant and remarkable.
Having won immortality he lived in a wonderful land,
Cultivating eternal life and escaping from worldly dust.
The holy priest did not recognize the stranger on Vulture Peak,
The Gold−crested Immortal of yesteryear.
The Great Sage Monkey did, however, recognize him. "Master," said Monkey, "this is the Great Gold−crested
Immortal who lives at the Jade Truth Temple at the foot of Vulture Peak. He is here to greet us." Only then
did Sanzang realize who he was and step forward to salute him.
"You have finally arrived here this year," replied the Great Immortal with a smile. "I was fooled by the
Bodhisattva Guanyin. Ten years ago she went to the East at the Buddha's command to find the Pilgrim who
would fetch the scriptures. She told me then he would be here within two or three years. I have been waiting
for years on end with no news of you at all. I never thought that it would be this year before we met."
Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang replied, "I am very grateful to you for your kindness,
Great Immortal, very grateful." Sanzang and his three disciples led the horse and carried the baggage with
them into the Taoist temple, where they were introduced to all the Great Immortals there. Tea and a vegetarian
meal were then ordered, and the Taoist boys were told to heat scented water for the holy monks to bathe in
before climbing to the Buddha land. Indeed:
When achievements are complete it is right to bathe;
The fundamental nature has been trained into innate truth.
Many thousand troubles and today:
The nine prohibitions and triple surrender lead to renewal.
The monsters all done with, they climb to the Buddha land;
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1365
With disasters ended they see the Sramana.
Dirt and filth now washed away, they are wholly pure;
Returning to the fundamental, their bodies are imperishable.
By the time master and disciples had bathed the day was drawing to a close. They spent the night in the Jade
Truth Temple.
The next morning the Tang Priest changed into his brocade cassock, put on his Vairocana mitre and grasped
his monastic staff in his hand to climb the steps of the main hall and take his leave of the Great Immortal.
"Yesterday you were in rags," the Great Immortal said with a smile, "but today you are dressed in splendor. I
can see from your appearance that you are indeed a son of the Buddha." Sanzang then bowed in farewell.
"Wait a moment," the Great Immortal said. "I will see you off."
"There's no need for you to see us off," Monkey replied. "I know the way."
"What you know," said the Great Immortal, "is the way by cloud. The holy monk has never gone by cloud. He
must go by the overland way."
"You're right," replied Monkey. "Although I've been here several times I've always come and gone by cloud.
I've never come here on foot. If there's an overland route I'll trouble you to see us along it. My master is very
serious about worshipping the Buddha, so I'd be very grateful if you could hurry up about it." The Great
Immortal chuckled as he took the Tang Priest by hand and led the Incense to the gate of the Dharma. The way
led not out by the temple's front entrance but through the main hall and out through the back gate.
Pointing towards Vulture Peak, the Great Immortal said, "Holy monk, do you see the auspicious light of many
colours and the richly textured aura in the sky? That is the summit of Vulture Peak, the holy territory of the
Lord Buddha." As soon as he saw it the Tang Priest bowed low.
"Master," said Brother Monkey with a smile, "we haven't got to the place for bowing yet. As the saying goes,
'The mountain may be in view, but your horse will collapse before you get there.' We're still quite a long way
from the place, so why start bowing now? If you bow all the way from here to the top, however many times
will you have to hit your head on the ground?"
"Holy monk," said the Great Immortal, "You, the Great Sage, Marshal Tian Peng, and the Curtain−raising
General have now reached the blessed land and seen Vulture Peak. I am going back now." Sanzang took his
leave of the Great Immortal and continued on his way.
The Great Sage led the Tang Priest and the others slowly up Vulture Peak. Within a couple of miles they
reached a river of mighty rolling waves some three miles wide. There was no sign of anyone anywhere
around.
"Wukong," said Sanzang with alarm, "we have come the wrong way. I wonder if the Great Immortal
misdirected us. This river is so wide and the waves so big, and there are no boats to be seen. How are we to
cross it?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1366
"He didn't send us the wrong way," replied Monkey with a smile. "Look over there. That's a bridge, isn't it?
Once we're over that we'll have completed the true achievement." When the venerable elder and the others
went closer to look they saw a tablet beside it on which were written the words CLOUDTOUCHING
CROSSING. Now this bridge was only a single log. Indeed:
From afar it seemed to span the void like a beam of jade;
Seen closer, the bridge was but a withered spar crossing the water.
To bind a river and frame the sea is easier
Than walking along the trunk of a single tree.
The glow of a myriad rainbows spread out all around;
A thousand lengths of fine white silk stretched to the edge of the sky.
It was narrow, slippery and hard to cross,
Unless one was a god who could walk on coloured clouds.
"Wukong," said Sanzang in fear and trembling, "no mortal man could cross that bridge. Let us look elsewhere
to find the way."
"But this is the way," replied Monkey with a smile, "this is the way."
"Nobody's going to dare cross that even if it is the right way," said Pig with alarm. "The river's so wide, and
there are those terrible waves, and all there is is that narrow, slippery tree−trunk. We couldn't take a single
step."
"You all stand there while I go on it to show you," replied Monkey.
The splendid Great Sage strode forward and sprang on the single−trunk bridge. He quickly ran across to the
other side, swaying as he went, and called out, "Come over, come over." The Tang Priest waved in refusal,
while Pig and Friar Sand bit their fingers and said, "It's much too hard."
Monkey then ran back again from the far side and pulled at Pig. "Come with me, you idiot," he said, "come
with me."
"It's too slippery, it's too slippery," said Pig, lying down on the ground. "I could never cross it. Please spare
me that and let me cross by wind and mist."
Monkey held him down as he replied, "This is no place for you to be allowed to go riding wind and mist. You
can only become a Buddha by crossing this bridge."
"Brother," said Pig, "I'll never make it. Honestly, I can't walk across."
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1367
As the two of them were pulling at each other and fighting, Friar Sand went over to talk them round. Only
then did they let go of each other. Sanzang then looked round to see a man poling a boat towards them from
downriver and shouting, "Ferry! Come aboard."
"Stop fooling around, disciples," said a delighted venerable elder. "There is a ferry−boat coming." The other
three sprang to their feet and all watched together as the boat drew closer. It was a bottomless craft.
Monkey had already spotted with the golden pupils in his fiery eyes that this was the Welcoming Lord
Buddha, who is also known as Ratnadhvaja, the Royal Buddha of Brightness, but instead of giving this away
he just kept calling, "Over here, punt, over here."
A moment later the ferryman had punted his boat up to the bank and was again shouting, "Ferry! Come
aboard!" Sanzang was once more alarmed at the sight. "Your boat has no bottom," he said, "so however could
you ferry anyone across?"
"This boat of mine," the Buddha said,
"Has been famous since Chaos was first divided,
And been punted by me without any changes.
It is stable in wind and stable in waves,
Enjoying great peace with no start and no end.
Untouched by the six types of dust, it returns to the One,
Carries on calmly through all kinds of calamity.
Hard it is for a bottomless boat to cross the oceans,
But since ancient times it has ferried all creatures."
The Great Sage Monkey put his hands together in front of his chest and thanked him with the words, "I am
grateful to you for your generosity in coming to welcome my master. Step aboard, Master. That boat of his
may have no bottom, but it's stable, and won't capsize even in wind and waves." The venerable elder was still
very doubtful, but Monkey seized him by the arms and pushed him forward. Unable to keep on his feet, the
master tumbled into the water, where the ferryman grabbed hold of him at once and stood him on the boat.
The master shook his clothes and stamped his feet, complaining about Monkey, who led Friar Sand and Pig to
stand on board bringing the luggage and the horse with them.
Gently and strongly the Buddha pushed off, at which a corpse came floating downstream, to the horror of the
venerable elder. "Don't be frightened, Master," said Monkey. "That's you."
"It's you, it's you," said Pig. Friar Sand clapped his hands as he said, "It's you, it's you!"
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1368
The boatman gave a call, then also put in, too, "It's you! Congratulations! Congratulations!" The three of them
all joined in these congratulations as the ferryman punted the boat quickly and steadily over the immortal
Cloud−touching Crossing. Sanzang turned around and sprang lightly ashore on the opposite bank. There is a
poem about this that goes:
When the womb−born flesh and body of blood is cast aside,
The primal spirit finds kinship and love.
On this morning of actions completed and Buddhahood attained
The thirty−six kinds of dust from the past are washed away.
This was indeed what is meant by great wisdom, the boundless dharma of crossing to the other bank. When
the four of them climbed the bank and looked back the bottomless boat had already disappeared, goodness
knew where. Only when Brother Monkey explained that it had been the Welcoming Buddha did Sanzang find
enlightenment At once he turned round to thank his three disciples.
"Let's not exchange thanks," said Monkey. "We've helped each other. You saved us three, Master, and showed
us the way to win merit so as to complete the true achievement. And we have protected you, Master, holding
to the faith and helping you happily to cast off your mortal body. Master, look at the magnificent scenery
ahead. Flowers, grasses, pines and bamboo, as well as phoenixes, cranes and deer. Compare it with those
places where evil beings created illusions through transformation. Ask yourself which is beautiful and good,
and which ugly and evil." Sanzang was full of expressions of gratitude. All of them were now light of body
and cheerful as they walked up Vulture Peak. Soon the ancient Thunder Monastery could be seen:
Its rooftops touched the heavens,
Its roots joined with the Sumeru range.
Amazing peaks spread out in serried rank;
Craggy rocks formed interlocking shapes.
Under the hanging scar were wonderful plants and flowers;
Beside the winding path grew magic mushrooms and orchids.
Immortal apes were picking the fruit of the peach trees,
Like gold amid burning flames;
White cranes perched in the branches of the pines
As if they were jade creatures amid smoke.
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1369
Coloured phoenixes in pairs,
Green phoenixes two by two.
The pairs of coloured phoenixes
Brought blessings on the world as they called to the sun;
The green phoenixes two by two
Danced in the wind, a rare and wonderful sight.
On the gleaming golden tiles were figures of mandarin ducks;
The brilliantly patterned bricks were set with agate.
To East and West
Were flowers of palaces and pearls of gateways;
To North and South
Were endless precious pavilions and high buildings.
The Devaraja Hall streamed with coloured light;
Purple flames rose before the Lokapalas Chamber.
Stupas stood out,
And fragrant were the blossoms of the udumbara tree.
Truly this was a place so fine it might have come from heaven,
Where the days seemed long under leisurely clouds.
Away from the mortal world, all fates came to an end;
All kalpas were complete within the Dharma hall.
As master and disciples walked freely and at their ease up to the summit of Vulture Peak lay people could be
seen under the green pines, and pious men and women amid the jade−coloured cypresses. The venerable elder
bowed to them politely, whereupon all the lay men and women, monks and nuns all hastened to put their
hands together and say to him, "Do not bow to us, holy monk. Come back and talk with us when you have
seen Sakyamuni."
"It's a bit early for that," replied Monkey with a grin. "Let's go and worship the boss."
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1370
The venerable elder waved his arms and performed a ritual dance as he followed Monkey straight to the gates
of the Thunder Monastery, where four great vajrapanis greeted them with the words, "Have you arrived now,
holy monk?"
"Yes," Sanzang replied with a bow, "Your disciple Xuanzang has arrived." Having given this reply he was
about to go in through the gateway.
"Please wait for a moment, holy monk," the vajrapanis said. "Let us report before you come in." The
vajrapanis sent a report of the Tang Priest's arrival to the four great vajrapanis on the middle gates, who in
turn reported it to the inner gates, inside which were divine monks making offerings.
As soon as they heard of the Tang Priest's arrival they all hurried to the Mahavira Hall, where they announced
to the Tathagata Sakyamuni Buddha, "The holy monk from the Tang Court has arrived at your noble
monastery to fetch the scriptures."
The Lord Buddha was very pleased. He called together his Eight Bodhisattvas, Four Vajrapanis, Five Hundred
Arhats, Three Thousand Protectors, Eleven Heavenly Shiners and Eighteen Guardians, who drew themselves
up in two lines and passed on the Buddha's command summoning the Tang Priest to enter. Thus it was that the
invitation was sent down from one level to the next: "Let the holy monk come in." Observing the
requirements of ritual, the Tang Priest went in through the gate with Wukong and Wujing, who were leading
the horse and carrying the luggage. Indeed:
In the past he had struggled to fulfil his commission
After leaving the emperor at the steps of the throne.
At dawn he had climbed mountains in mist and in dew;
At dusk he had slept on rocks amid the clouds.
He had carried his stick across three thousand rivers,
And climbed up countless crags with his monastic staff.
His every thought had been set on the true achievement,
And today he was finally to see the Tathagata.
As the four of them arrived in front of the Mahavira Hall they all prostrated themselves and kowtowed to the
Tathagata, then to their left and right. After they had each completed three rounds of Worship they then knelt
before the Buddha to present their passport. When the Tathagata had read it carefully he handed it back to
Sanzang, who bowed his head low and reported, "Your disciple Xuanzang has made the long journey to your
precious monastery at the command of the Great Tang emperor to beg for the true scriptures that will save all
living beings. I implore the Lord Buddha in his goodness to grant them at once so that I may return to my
country."
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1371
The Tathagata then opened his compassionate mouth and in the great mercy of his heart said to Sanzang,
"Your Eastern land is in the Southern Continent of Jambu. As the sky is lofty there, the soil deep, its products
many, and the people multitudinous there is much covetous−ness, murder, debauchery, lying, deception and
dishonesty. They do not follow the Buddhist teaching, do not turn towards good destinies, and do not honour
the sun, moon and stars or value the five grains. They are not loyal, filial, righteous or kind. In the delusion of
their hearts they mislead themselves, cheating on weights and measures, taking life and killing animals, thus
creating such boundless evil karma and such a superabundance of sin and evil that they bring the catastrophe
of hell on themselves. That is why they must fall for ever into the dark underworld to suffer the torments of
being hammered, smashed, ground and pounded, or are reborn as animals. Many of them take the shape of
furry, horned creatures to pay back the debts they owe from earlier lives and feed others with their own flesh.
It is for such reasons that some fall into the Avici Hell, from which they never emerge to be reborn. Although
Confucius established the doctrine of benevolence, righteousness, correct behavior and wisdom, and although
successive emperors have applied the penalties of imprisonment, exile strangulation and beheading, none of
this affected those stupid, benighted, self−indulgent and unrestrained people. Why? I have Three Stores of
scriptures that offer deliverance from suffering and release from disaster. Of these Three Stores one is the
Store of Dharma that deals with Heaven; one is the Store of Sastras that deal with the Earth, and one is the
Store of Sutras that can save ghosts. There are thirty−five scriptures altogether, in 15,144 scrolls. These are
indeed the path to the truth, the gateway to goodness. They include everything about the astronomy,
geography, personalities, birds beasts trees, flowers, objects of use and human affairs of the world's four
continents. Now that you have come from afar I would present them all to you to take away with you, but the
people of your country are stupid and coarse. They are slanderers of the truth who cannot understand the
mysteries of our teachings. Ananda, Kasyapa," he called, "take the four of them to the foot of the jewel tower
and give them a vegetarian meal. After the meal open up the pavilion, select a few rolls from each of the
thirty−five scriptures in my Three Stores, and tell them to propagate these scriptures in the East, where they
may eternally grant their great goodness."
Acting on the orders of the Buddha the two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the bottom of the tower, where
no end of rare and wonderful jewels and treasures were set out. Here the divinities who made offerings set out
a vegetarian banquet, with immortal food, immortal delicacies, immortal tea, immortal fruit, and every kind of
culinary delight not to be found in the mortal world. Master and disciples bowed their heads to the ground in
thanks for the Buddha's kindness and proceeded to eat to their hearts' content. Indeed
Precious flames and golden light dazzled the eye,
While the rare incense and delicacies were marvelously fine.
The thousand−storied golden pavilion was infinitely lovely,
And pure sounded immortals' music on the ear.
Meatless food and magic flowers of the sort that are rare on earth,
Fragrant teas and exotic dishes that give eternal life.
After a long period of enduring a thousand kinds of suffering,
Today comes the glorious happiness of the Way completed.
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1372
This was a piece of good fortune for Pig, and a great, benefit to Friar Sand as they ate their fill of the food in
the Buddha's land that gave eternal life and new flesh and bones for old. The two arhats kept the four of them
company till the meal was over, after which they went to the treasure pavilion, where the doors were opened
for them to go in and look. Over this all was a thousandfold aura of coloured light and auspicious vapors,
while brilliant mists and clouds of good omen wafted all around. All over the scripture shelves and on the
outside of the cases were pasted red labels on which were neatly written the titles of the scriptures. They were
the

Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to read the titles of all the scriptures.
"You have come here from the East, holy monk," they said to him. "Have you brought us any presents? Hand
them over right now, then we can give you the scriptures."
When Sanzang heard this he said, "Your disciple Xuanzang has come a very long way, and I did not bring any
with me."
"That's very fine," the two arhats said with a laugh. "If we hand the scriptures over for nothing, they'll be
passed down through the ages and our successors will have to starve to death." Monkey could not stand
hearing them talking tough like this and refusing to hand the scriptures over, so he shouted, "Let's go and
report them to the Tathagata, Master. We'll get him to give me the scriptures himself."
"Shut up!" said Kasyapa. "Where do you think you are, acting up like this? Come here and take the
scriptures." Pig and Friar Sand, who were keeping their own tempers under control, calmed Monkey down.
They turned back to accept the scriptures, which were packed one by one into the luggage. Some of it was put
on the horse's back, and the rest tied up as two carrying−pole loads that Pig and Friar Sand shouldered. They
all then returned to the Buddha's throne, kowtowed, thanked the Tathagata and went straight out. They bowed
twice to every Buddha and every Bodhisattva they met. When they reached the main entrance they bowed to
the bhiksus, the bhiksunis, the laymen and the laywomen, taking their leave of each one. Then they hurried
back down the mountain.
The story tells not of them but of the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara, who had been quietly listening in the
library when the scriptures were handed over. He understood perfectly well that Ananda and Kasyapa had
handed over wordless scriptures. "Those stupid monks from the East didn't realize that those were wordless
scriptures," he thought with a smile to himself. "The holy monks journey across all those mountains and rivers
will be a complete waste. Who is in attendance here?" he called, and the arhat Suklavira stepped forward.
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1374
"Use your divine might," Dipamkara instructed him, "and go after the Tang Priest like a shooting star. Take
the wordless scriptures from him and tell him to come back to fetch the true scriptures." The arhat Suklavira
then flew off on a storm wind that roared away from the Thunder Monastery as he gave a great display of his
divine might. That splendid wind really was
A warrior from the Buddha's presence,
Greater than the two wind gods of the Xun quarter.
The angry roars from his divine orifices
Were more powerful by far than the puffs of a young girl.
This wind made
Fish and dragons lose their dens,
While the waves flowed backwards in rivers and seas.
Black apes could not present the fruit they carried;
Yellow cranes turned back to the clouds as they sought their nests.
Ugly rang the song of the red phoenix;
Raucous were the calls of the multicolored pheasants.
The branches of hoary pines were broken
As the flowers of the udumbara blew away.
Every cane of green bamboo bowed low;
All the blooms of golden lotus swayed.
The sound of the bell was carried a thousand miles
While the chanting of sutras flew lightly up the ravines.
Ruined was the beauty of flowers under the crag;
The tender shoots of plants were laid low by the path
The brilliant phoenixes could hardly spread their wings;
White deer hid beneath the cliffs.
The heavens were heavy with fragrance
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1375
As the clear wind blew right through the clouds.
The Tang Priest was walking along when he smelt the fragrant wind, but he paid no attention to it, taking it
for an auspicious sign of the Lord Buddha. Then a noise could be heard as a hand reached down from midair
to lift the scriptures lightly off the horse's back, which gave Sanzang such a shock that he beat his chest and
howled aloud. Pig scrambled along in pursuit, Friar Sand guarded the carrying−poles loaded with scriptures,
and Brother Monkey flew after the arhat. Seeing that Monkey had almost caught up with him, and frightened
that the merciless cudgel would make no bones about wounding him badly, the arhat tore the bundle of
scriptures to shreds and flung it into the dust. When Monkey saw the bundle falling in pieces that were being
scattered by the fragrant wind he stopped chasing the arhat and brought his cloud down to look after the
scriptures. The arhat Suklavira put the wind and the clouds away, then went back to report to Dipamkara.
When Pig, who was also in pursuit, saw the scriptures falling he helped Monkey to collect them up and carry
them back to the Tang Priest. "Disciples," the Tang Priest exclaimed, tears pouring from his eyes, "even in
this world of bliss evil demons cheat people." After gathering up the scattered scriptures in his arms Friar
Sand opened one of them up and saw that it was as white as snow: not a word was written on it.
Quickly he handed it to Sanzang with the remark, "There's nothing in this scroll, Master." Monkey opened out
another scroll to find that it had nothing written in it either. Pig opened another and it too had nothing in it.
"Open them all for us to examine," said Sanzang. Every single scroll was blank paper.
"We Easterners really do have no luck," he said, sighing and groaning. "What point is there in fetching
wordless scriptures like these? How could I ever face the Tang emperor? I will have no way of avoiding
execution for the crime of lying to my sovereign."
Monkey, who already understood what had happened, then said to the Tang Priest, "Say no more, Master.
Ananda and Kasyapa gave us these scrolls of blank paper because we hadn't got any presents to give them
when they asked for them. Let's go back, report them to the Tathagata and get them accused of extortion."
"That's right," shouted Pig, "that's right. Let's report them." The four of them then hurried up the mountain
again, and after a few steps they were rushing back to the Thunder Monastery.
Before long they were once more outside the gates of the monastery, where everyone raised their clasped
hands in greeting. "Have you holy monks come to exchange your scriptures?" they asked with smiles.
Sanzang nodded and expressed his thanks. The vajrapanis did not block them, but let them go straight in to the
Mahavira Hall.
"Tathagata," yelled Monkey, "our master and the rest of us have had to put up with endless monsters, demons,
troubles and hardships to get here from the East to worship you. You gave the orders for the scriptures to be
handed over, but Ananda and Kasyapa didn't do so because they were trying to extort things from us. They
conspired and deliberately let us take away blank paper versions without a single word written on them. But
what's the point in taking those? I beg you to have them punished, Tathagata."
"Stop yelling," replied the Lord Buddha with a smile. "I already know that they asked you for presents. But
the scriptures cannot be casually passed on. Nor can they be taken away for nothing. In the past bhiksus and
holy monks went down the mountain and recited these scriptures to the family of the elder Zhao in the land of
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1376
Sravasti. This ensured peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of the family. All
that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of granular gold. I said they had sold the scriptures too
cheap, so I saw to it that Zhao's sons and grandsons would be poor. You were given blank texts because you
came here to fetch them empty−handed. The blank texts are true, wordless scriptures, and they really are
good. But as you living beings in the East are so deluded and have not achieved enlightenment we'll have to
give you these ones instead. Ananda, Kasyapa," he called, "fetch the true scriptures with words at once.
Choose a few rolls from each title to give them, then come back here and tell me how many."
The two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the foot of the library building and once again asked the Tang
Priest for a present. Having nothing else to offer, he ordered friar Sand to bring out the begging bowl of purple
gold and presented it with both hands. "Your disciple is poor and has come a very long way," he said, "and I
did not bring any presents with me. This bowl was given to me by the Tang emperor with his own hands to
beg for food with on my journey. I now offer it to you as a token of my heartfelt feelings. I beg you arhats not
to despise it but to keep it. When I return to my court I shall report this to the Tang emperor, who will
certainly reward you richly. I only ask you to give me the true scriptures that have words to save me from
failing in my imperial mission and making this long, hard journey for nothing."
Ananda accepted the bowl with no more than a hint of a smile. The warriors guarding the precious library
building, the kitchen staff responsible for the spices and the arhats in charge of the library rubbed each other's
faces, patted each other's backs, flicked each other with their fingers and pulled faces.
"Disgraceful," they all said with grins, "disgraceful. Demanding presents from the pilgrims who've come to
fetch the scriptures!" A moment later Ananda was frowning with embarrassment but still holding the bowl
and not letting go. Only then did Kasyapa go into the library to check the scriptures through one by one and
give them to Sanzang.
"Disciples," called Sanzang, "take a good look at them, not like last time." The three of them took the rolls
and examined them one by one. All had words. 5,048 rolls were handed over, the total in a single store. They
were neatly packed up and put on the horse, and those left over were made into a carrying−pole load for Pig to
take. Friar Sand carried their own luggage, and as Brother Monkey led the horse the Tang Priest took his staff,
pushed his Vairocana mitre into position, shook his brocade cassock, and went happily into the presence of
the Tathagata. Indeed:
Sweet taste the True Scriptures of the Great Store,
Created fine and majestic by the Tathagata.
Remember what Xuanzang suffered to climb this mountain:
Ananda's greed was something ridiculous.
What they did not notice at first Dipamkara helped them to see;
Later the scriptures were real and they then found peace.
Successful now, they would take the scriptures to the East;
Where all could be refreshed by their life−giving richness.
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1377
Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to see the Tathagata, who ascended his lotus throne and directed the
two great arhats Dragon−queller and Tiger−subduer to strike the cloud−ringing stone chimes that summoned
all the Three Thousand Buddhas, Three Thousand Protectors, Eight Vajrapanis, Four Bodhisattvas, Five
Hundred Arhats, Eight Hundred Bhiksus, the host of laymen, bhiksunis, laywomen, and the greater and lesser
honoured ones and holy monks of every cave, every heaven, the blessed lands and the magic mountains.
Those who were supposed to sit were asked to ascend their precious thrones, and those who were supposed to
stand stood on either side. All of a sudden heavenly music rang out from afar and magical sounds wafted
around. The air was full of countless beams of auspicious light and of aura upon aura as all the Buddhas
gathered together to pay their respects to the Tathagata.
"How many rolls of scripture have you given them, Ananda and Kasyapa?" the Tathagata asked. "Please tell
me the numbers one by one."
The two arhats then reported, "We are now handing over for the Tang court the

From the thirty−five scriptures in all of the stores we have selected 5,048 rolls to give to the holy monk. These
will be kept and handed down in Tang. They have now all been packed neatly and put on the horse or made
into carrying−pole loads. The pilgrims are only waiting to express their thanks."
Sanzang and his three followers then tethered the horse, put down the loads, joined their hands in front of their
chests and bowed in worship.
"The achievement of these scriptures is immeasurable," the Tathagata said to the Tang Priest, "Although they
are the source of foreknowledge and reflection for my school they are truly the origin of all Three Schools. If
they reach your Southern Continent of Jambudvipa they must not be treated with disrespect when they are
shown to all living beings. Nobody who has not bathed, avoided eating meat and observed the prohibitions
Journey to the West
Chapter 98 1379
may open the rolls. Treasure them. Honour them. They include the esoteric mysteries of the way of
immortality and wonderful methods for discovering all transformations." Kowtowing in thanks, Sanzang faith
fully accepted these instructions and determined to carry them out, did three more circuits of homage round
the Lord Buddha then with dutiful and sincere obedience accepted the scriptures and went out with them
through the third of the monastery gates, where he thanked all the holy beings one by one again. Of him we
will say no more.
After sending the Tang Priest on his way the Tathagata dissolved the assembly that had been called to pass on
the scriptures. The Bodhisattva Guanyin then stepped forward from the side, put her hands together and
submitted to the lord Buddha, "It has been fourteen years from the time when your disciple went to the East
that year to find the man who would fetch the scriptures to his success today. That makes 5,040 days. May the
World−honoured One allow the holy monks to go back East from the West within eight days, so as to
complete the number of rolls in one store, and then your disciple may report his mission as completed."
"What you say is quite right," replied the Tathagata with delight. "You are permitted to report the completion
of your mission." With that he instructed the Eight Vajrapanis, "You are to use your divine might to escort the
holy monks back to the East, where they will hand the true scriptures over to be kept there. After escorting the
holy monks back, you may return to the West. This must be done within eight days in order to match the
number of rolls in one store. There must be no disobedience or delay." The vajrapanis caught up with the
Tang Priest. "Come with us, scripture−fetchers," they called; and the Tang Priest and the others became light
and strong as they floated up on clouds after the vajrapanis. Indeed:
Nature revealed and mind made clear, they visited the Buddha;
Actions complete and all achieved, they flew aloft.
If you do not know how they passed on the scriptures after returning to the East, listen to the explanation in
the next installment.

After the Triple Threes Are Fulfilled the Way Returns to Its Roots
The story goes on to tell how the Eight Vajrapanis escorted the Tang Priest back to their country, but we will
not go into that now.
Outside the gates the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Four Duty Gods, the Six Dings, the
Six Jias and the Guardians of the Faith went up to the Bodhisattva Guanyin and said, "We, your disciples,
have given secret help to the holy monk in obedience to your dharma command, Bodhisattva. Now that they
have fulfilled their deeds and you have reported your mission accomplished to the Lord Buddha, we would
like to report the completion of our mission."
"Permission granted." The Bodhisattva replied with delight, "permission granted." The Bodhisattva then went
on to ask, "What were the thoughts and actions of the Tang Priest and his three disciples on their journey?"

Chapter 99 1380
"They really were pious and determined," the deities all replied, "as we are sure will not have escaped your
profound perception. But the Tang Priest's sufferings truly beggar description. Your disciples have made a
careful record of the disasters and hardships that he has endured on his journey. This is the account of his
ordeals." The Bodhisattva read it through from the beginning, and this is what was written in it:

And the ordeals of the holy monk are all clearly recorded."
Casting her eyes over the record, the Bodhisattva quickly said, "In the Buddha's school 'nine nines' are needed
before one can come to the truth. The eighty ordeals that the holy monk has endured are one short of the full
number. "Go after the vajrapanis," she ordered a protector, "and tell them to create another ordeal." The
protector headed East by cloud as soon as he was given this order, and after a day and a night he caught up
with the Eight Vajrapanis. "It's like this, you see," he said, whispering in their ears in explanation, adding, "so
you must do as the Bodhisattva commands and not disobey." When the Eight Vajrapanis heard this they
stopped the wind with a swishing sound and dropped the four of them to the ground, horse, scriptures and all.
Oh dear! It was a case of
The Way of reaching the truth through the nine nines is hard;
Hold fast to your determination to stand at the mysterious pass.
Only through rigorous effort can the demons be repelled;
Perseverance is essential to the true Dharma's return.
Do not mistake the scriptures for something easily won;
Of many a kind were the hardships endured by the holy monk.
The marvellous union has always been hard to achieve:
The slightest mistake and the elixir will not be made.

Chapter 99 1384
As his feet touched common ground Sanzang felt alarmed. "Marvellous," said Pig, roaring with laughter, "just
marvellous! It's a case of more haste less speed."
"It really is marvellous," said Friar Sand. "They're giving us a rest here after going so fast."
"As the saying goes," remarked the Great Sage, "'Wait ten days on a sandbank, then cross nine in a single
day.'"
"Stop arguing, you three," said Sanzang. "Find out which way we have come and where we are."
"We're here!" said Friar Sand after looking all around, "We're here! Listen to the water, Master."
"From the sound of the water I suppose it must be your family home," observed Brother Monkey.
"His home is the River of Flowing Sands," said Pig.
"No, it's not that," replied Friar Sand. "It's the River of Heaven."
"Take a careful look at the other side, disciple," said Sanzang, at which Monkey sprang into the air, shaded his
eyes with his hand, and took a careful look around. "Master," he said after coming down again, "this is the
West bank of the River of Heaven."
"I remember now," said Sanzang. "On the East bank there is Chen Family Village. When we came here the
other year they were so grateful to us for rescuing their son and daughter that they wanted to build a boat to
take us across, but the White Soft−shelled Turtle carried us over. As I recall, there was no sign of human life
anywhere on the West bank. Whatever are we to do now?"
"They say that common mortals can be sinners," said Pig, "but the vajrapanis who serve the Buddha in person
are too. The Buddha ordered them to bring us back East, so why have they dropped us half way home? We're
stuck here now. How ever are we going to get over?"
"Stop complaining, brother," said Friar Sand. "Our master has found the Way. He cast off his mortal body at
the Cloud−touching Crossing, so he won't possibly fall into the water now. Our big brother and we two can all
do levitation magic, so we can carry the master across."
Monkey laughed to himself under his breath as he replied, "We can't do it, we can't do it." Why do you think
he said that they couldn't do it? If he had been prepared to use his divine powers and give away the secret of
flying then master and disciples would have been able to cross a thousand rivers. But he understood that as the
Tang Priest had not yet completed the nine nines he was fated to undergo another ordeal, which was why he
had been held up here.
Talking as they walked slowly along, master and disciples headed straight to the river−bank, where all of a
sudden they heard someone calling, "This way, Tang Priest, this way!" They were all surprised, and when
they looked up there was no sign of anyone around, and no boat either.
There was only a big, white, scabby−headed soft−shelled turtle raising its head by the bank and calling,
"Master, I have been waiting for you all these years. Why have you only just come back?"
"We troubled you in the past, old turtle," said Monkey with a smile, "and this year we meet again." Sanzang,
Pig and Friar Sand were all delighted.
Journey to the West
Chapter 99 1385
"If you really do want to look after us, come ashore," Monkey said, at which the turtle climbed out of the river
with a bound. Monkey had the horse tied to the turtle with Pig squatting behind the horse's tail. The Tang
Priest stood to the left of the horse's neck and Friar Sand to its right, while Monkey stood with one foot on the
turtle's neck and the other on his head.
"Take it easy and take it steady," he said. The turtle strode across the water just as if his four feet were
walking on flat land, carrying the master and his three disciples, five of them altogether including the horse,
straight back to the Eastern bank. This was Indeed:
The mystery of the Dharma within the unique sect:
When the demons are all defeated man and heaven are made known.
Only now can the original face be seen,
And the causes of the one body all be complete.
Hold to the Three Vehicles to come and go at will;
After the elixir's nine transformations you may do what you like.
Carry your bundle, let your staff fly, and understand the inexpressible;
Lucky they were on their return to meet the Ancient Turtle.
Carrying them on his back, the Ancient Soft−shelled Turtle walked across the waves for the best part of a day.
It was nearly evening when, as they approached the East bank, he suddenly asked, "Venerable master, some
years ago I begged you when you reached the West and saw our Tathagata Buddha to ask him when I would
be converted and how long I would live."
Now ever since the venerable elder had reached the Western Heaven, bathed in the Jade Truth Temple, cast
off his mortal body at the Cloud−touching Crossing and walked up the Vulture Peak, his heart had been set
only on worshipping the Buddha; and when he met all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, holy monks and others his
whole mind had been devoted to fetching the scriptures. He had given no attention to anything else, and so
had not asked about how long the Ancient Turtle would live. Having nothing he could say, and not daring to
lie to or deceive the turtle, Sanzang was quiet for a long time and gave no reply. When the turtle realized that
Sanzang had not asked the questions on his behalf he gave a shake of his head and submerged with a loud
splash, dropping the four of them, horse, scriptures and all, into the water.
Oh dear! But luckily the Tang Priest had cast off his mortal body and achieved the Way. If he had still been as
he had before he would have sunk to the bottom. It was also lucky that the white horse was a dragon, that Pig
and Friar Sand could swim, and that Brother Monkey gave a smiling and magnificent display of his great
magic powers as he lifted the Tang Priest out of the water and up the East bank. The only thing was that the
bundles of scriptures, the clothes and the saddle were all soaked.
Master and disciples had climbed up the bank to get themselves sorted out when a sudden fierce wind blew
up, the sky turned dark, and amid thunder and lightning stones and sand flew all around. This is what could be
Journey to the West
Chapter 99 1386
seen:
A wind
Throwing heaven and earth into chaos;
Thunder
Rocking mountains and rivers;
Lightning
Flying like fire through the clouds;
Mists
Covering all of the earth.
The wind howled;
Loud roared the thunder.
The lightning streaked red,
While clouds blocked out the moon and the stars.
The wind−blown dust drove into the face,
And tigers and leopards hid in terror.
The lightning flashes set birds cawing,
And tress all vanished in the spreading mists.
The wind whipped up the waves of the River of Heaven;
The thunder terrified the fish and dragons in the River of Heaven;
The lightning lit up the whole of River of Heaven;
The mists enshrouded in darkness the banks of the River of Heaven.
Splendid wind!
Mountains toppled; pines and bamboo fell.
Splendid thunder!
Its majesty alarmed insects and spread terror.
Journey to the West
Chapter 99 1387
Splendid lightning!
It moved across the sky and lit up the wilds like golden snakes.
Splendid mist!
Darkening the whole of space, obscuring the nine heavens.
This alarmed Sanzang, who pressed down on the bundles of scriptures, while Friar Sand held down their
carrying−pole and Pig clung to the white horse. Monkey, however, swung his iron cudgel around with both
hands as he kept guard to both right and left.
Now the wind, mist, thunder and lightning were all signals made by evil demons who wanted to steal the
scriptures that had been fetched. They tried all night to grab them until the dawn; only then did they stop.
The venerable elder, whose clothes were all soaking wet, shivered and shook as he said, "How did all this
start, Wukong?"
"Master," Brother Monkey replied, snorting with fury, "you don't understand the inner truth. By escorting you
to fetch these scriptures we have won the great achievement of heaven and earth. You will enjoy perpetual
youth, and your dharma body will never decay. This is something heaven and earth can't stand for, and the
demons and gods detest. They wanted to come and steal them in the darkness. But because the scriptures were
soaked through and your true dharma body was holding them down, the thunder could not bombard them, the
lightning could not illuminate them and the mist could not obscure them. It was also because I whirled my
iron cudgel around to make its pure Positive nature protect them. Since dawn the Positive has been in the
ascendant again, which is why they can't take them now."
Only then did Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand realize what had happened and all express unbounded thanks. A
little later, when the sun was shining from high in the sky, they took the scriptures to the top of a high cliff,
opened the bundles and put them out to dry. The rocks on which the scriptures were dried in the sun remain
there to this day. Then they spread their clothes and shoes out to dry beside the cliff while they stood there, sat
down, or leapt around. Indeed:
The pure Positive body was happy in the sun,
When Negative demons dared not use their might.
Even when water is dominant the true scriptures will win,
Not fearing wind or thunder, lightning, mist or light.
After this clarification they come to the true perception;
From now on they will reach the immortals' land in peace.
On the rocks where the scriptures were dried their traces still remain;
Journey to the West
Chapter 99 1388
Never again will any demons come back to this place.
As the four of them were checking through the scriptures and drying them in the sun one by one some
fishermen who were passing the river bank lifted up their heads and saw them there.
One of the fishermen recognized them and said, "Venerable teachers, didn't you cross this river the other year
when you were on your way to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures?"
"Yes, yes," said Pig, "that's right. Where are you from? How did you know who we are?"
"We're from Chen Village," the fisherman replied.
"How far is Chen Village from here?" Pig asked.
"It's seven miles South from this gulch," the fisherman said.
"Let's take the scriptures to Chen Village and dry them there," said Pig. "There's somewhere we can stay
there, and we'll be able to get something to eat. Besides, we can get their family to wash our clothes. That'll be
best, won't it?"
"We will not go there," said Sanzang. "When we have dried everything here we can pack up and find our way
back."
The fishermen, who passed the gulch to the South, happened to meet Chen Cheng. "You two old gentlemen,"
they called, "the teachers who went to be sacrificed instead of your children the other year have come back."
"Where did you see them?" Chen Cheng asked.
"Drying their scriptures in the sun on the rocks," the fishermen replied.
Chen Cheng then took several of his tenants across the gulch, saw the pilgrims, and hurried towards them to
kneel and say, "My lords, now that you are coming back with your scriptures, your achievement completed
and your deeds done, why don't you come to my house? Why are you hanging around here? Won't you please
come straight to the house?"
"We'll go with you when we've dried our scriptures in the sun," Monkey replied.
"How did your scriptures and clothes all get wet, my lords?" Chen Cheng asked.
"The other year the White soft−shelled Turtle kindly carried us West across the river," Sanzang replied, "and
this year he carried us across it Eastwards. We were approaching the bank when he put some questions to me
about the enquiries he had asked me to make with the Lord Buddha about how long he would live. Now I
never made this enquiry, so he soaked us all in the water. That was how they got wet."
Sanzang then told the whole story in all its details, and as Chen Cheng was so sincere in pressing his
invitation Sanzang could do nothing but pack up the scriptures. As it was not realized that the ends of several
rolls of the Buddhacaritakavya sutra had stuck to the rock when wet, the ends were torn off, which is why the
Buddhacaritakavya sutra is incomplete to this day and there are still traces of writing on the rocks where the
scriptures were dried in the sun.
Journey to the West
Chapter 99 1389
"We were careless," Sanzang said with remorse. "We did not pay enough attention."
"You're wrong," said Monkey with a laugh, "you're wrong. Heaven and earth are incomplete and this scripture
used to be complete. Now it's been soaked and torn to fulfil the mystery of incompleteness. This is not
something that could have been achieved through human effort." When master and disciples had finished
packing the surras they returned with Chen Chang to his village.
In the village one person told ten, ten told a hundred, and a hundred a thousand, till all of them, young and
old, came out to welcome and see the pilgrims. As soon as Chen Qing heard of it he had an incense table set
out to greet them in front of the gates; he also ordered drummers and players of wind instruments to perform.
A moment later the travelers arrived and were welcomed and taken inside. Chen Qing led out his whole
household to greet them with bows and thank them for their earlier kindness in saving their son and daughter.
Tea and a vegetarian meal were then ordered; but since receiving the immortal food and immortal delicacies
of the Lord Buddha and casting off his mortal body to become a Buddha, Sanzang had lost all desire for
mortals' food. As the two old men's urgings were so insistent, he took some of the food as a mark of gratitude.
The Great Sage Monkey had never been one to eat cooked food, so he said, "That will be enough."
Friar Sand did not eat either, and even Pig was not the Pig he used to be: he soon put his bowl down.
"Aren't you eating any more either, idiot?" Monkey asked.
"I don't know why," Pig said, "but my stomach's gone weak all of a sudden." The vegetarian banquet was then
cleared away as the old men asked about how they had fetched the scriptures. Sanzang then gave them a
detailed account that started with the bath in the Jade Truth Temple and the lightening of their bodies at
Cloud−touching Crossing and went on to tell how they had seen the Tathagata at Thunder Monastery, been
feasted at the jeweled tower, given the scriptures in the precious library−−wordless scriptures at first because
when the two arhats had demanded presents they had refused them−−had gone back to pay their respects to
the Tathagata again to be given the number of rolls in a single store, had been plunged into the water by the
White Soft−shelled Turtle, and nearly had the scriptures stolen in the darkness by evil spirits. After telling all
this Sanzang took his leave.
But the whole family of the two old men was not at all willing to let them go. "We have been under a great
debt to you for saving our children that we have not yet been able to repay," they said. "We have built a
Temple of Deliverance where incense has been burned to you ever since without ceasing." Then they called
out the children in whose place Monkey and Pig had gone to be sacrificed, Chen Guan−given and Pan of
Gold, to kowtow in thanks and ask them into the shrine to take a look. Sanzang then put the bundles of
scriptures in front of the hall of their house and read them one roll of the Precious Eternity sutra. Then they
went to the temple, where the Chens had set out delicacies. Before the pilgrims could sit down another group
of people came to invite them to another meal, and before they could pick up their chopsticks yet another
group came with a third invitation. This went on and on without end, so that they had no chance to eat
properly. Sanzang, who dared not decline the invitations, had to make gestures of eating. The shrine was
indeed most handsomely built:
The gateway was thickly painted in red
Thanks to the generous donors.
A tower rose there

Where houses with a pair of cloisters had now been built.
Red were the doors
And the Seven Treasures were finely carved.
Incense floated up to the clouds;
Pure light filled the vault of space.
Some tender cypress saplings were still being watered;
A number of pine trees did not yet form a grove.
Living waters met one in front
Where the waves of the River of Heaven were rolling;
High cliffs rose behind
Where range upon range of mountains joined the earth dragon.
When Sanzang has seen everything he climbed the high tower, where statues of the four pilgrims had been
placed. "Looks just like you, brother," said pig, tugging at Monkey, when he saw them.
"Second brother," said Friar Sand, "Your statue's just like you too. The only thing is that the master's is too
good−looking."
"It is very good," said Sanzang, "it is very good." They then came downstairs, where people were still waiting,
and urged them to eat the vegetarian food that was set out in the hall and in the cloisters behind it.
"What happened to the Great King's Temple that used to be here?" Brother Monkey asked.
"It was demolished that year," the old men replied. "My lords, we have had good harvests every year since
this monastery was established, thanks to your lordships' blessed protection."
"That was heaven's gift," said Monkey with a smile, "nothing to do with us. But after we have gone this time I
guarantee that the families in your village will have many sons and grandsons, flourishing livestock, wind and
rain at the right time year in and year out, and rain and wind year out and year in at the right time." The people
all kowtowed in thanks.
What could then be seen were a countless number of people lined up behind each other to offer fruit and other
vegetarian food. "I'll be blowed," said Pig with a laugh. "In the old days, when I could eat, nobody ever asked
me to do so ten times over. But now, when I can't, one family won't wait for another to finish before offering
me food."
Although he was feeling full he did get going a little and ate eight or nine meatless dishes; and despite having
an injured stomach he also downed twenty or thirty steamed breadrolls. When they were all full, more people
came with further invitations. "Grateful though I am for your great affection," Sanzang said, "I do not deserve
Journey to the West
Chapter 99 1391
it. I hope that we may be allowed to rest tonight. Tomorrow morning we will accept some more."
It was now late at night. Sanzang, who was guarding the true scriptures and would not leave them for a
moment, sat in meditation at the foot of the tower to keep a vigil. As the third watch of the night approached
he said quietly, "Wukong, the people here know that we have found the Way and completed our undertaking.
As the old saying goes, 'The true adept does not show his face; who shows his face is no true adept.' I am
afraid that if we tarry too long here that we may fail in our main enterprise."
"What you say is right, Master," Monkey replied. "Let's slip quietly away in the middle of the night while
they're all sound asleep." Pig too understood, Friar Sand comprehended very clearly, and the white horse also
knew what he meant. So they got up, quietly loaded the packs, shouldered the poles, and carried the things out
along the cloister. When they reached the main gates and found them locked Monkey used unlocking magic to
open the inner gates and the main gates. They followed the path East, only to hear the Eight Vajrapanis calling
from mid−air. "Come with us, escapers." The venerable elder then smelt incense as he rose up into the air.
This was indeed a case of:
When the elixir is formed one sees the original face;
When the body is strong one can then visit one's sovereign.
If you do not know how he saw the Tang emperor, listen to the explanation in the next installment.
Chapter 100
The Journey Back to the East Is Made
The Five Immortals Achieve Nirvana
We will tell not of how the four travelers escaped and rose on the wind with the vajrapanis, but of the many
people in the Temple of Deliverance in Chen Village. After they rose at dawn to prepare more fruit and
delicacies to offer they came to the ground floor of the tower and found the Tang Priest gone. Some asked
questions and others searched. They were all thrown into panic and did not know what to do.
"We've let those living Buddhas all get clean away," they lamented as their howls rose to the skies. As there
was nothing else they could do about it they carried all the food they had prepared to the ground floor of the
tower as offerings and burned imitation paper money. From then on four major sacrifices and twenty−four
minor sacrifices were held every year. In addition people praying for cures or safety, seeking marriages,
making vows, and seeking wealth or sons came at every hour of every day to bum incense and make
offerings. Indeed:
Incense smoked in the golden burner for a thousand years;
The light burned in the lamps of jade through eternity.
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1392
We will say no more of this, but tell of how the Eight Vajrapanis used a second fragrant wind to carry the four
pilgrims off again. Some days later they reached the East, and Chang'an came gradually into view. Now after
seeing the Tang Priest off from the city on the twelfth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of Then
Guan the Emperor Taizong had in the sixteenth year sent officials of his Department of Works to build a
Watching For the Scriptures Tower outside the city of Chang'an to receive the scriptures. Here Taizong went
in person every year. It so happened that on the very day the emperor went to the tower the Western sky was
filled with auspicious light and gusts of scented wind.
"Holy monk," the vajrapanis said, stopping in mid air, "this is the city of Chang'an. We cannot come down as
the people here are too clever: we are afraid that they might give away what we look like. The Great Sage
Monkey and the other two gentlemen cannot go there either. You must go there yourself to hand the scriptures
to your monarch then come back here. We will be waiting for you up in the clouds ready to go to report back
on your mission."
"Although what you respected gentlemen say is right," replied the Great Sage, "how could my master possibly
shoulder the pole for carrying the scriptures? And how could he lead this horse? We'll have to take him there.
May I trouble you to wait a moment up in the air? We wouldn't dare keep you waiting."
"The other day the Bodhisattva Guanyin informed the Tathagata," the vajrapanis replied, "that the return
journey would take only eight days, so as to make up the number of rolls of scriptures in the Tripitaka. We
have already spent over four days, and we are worried that Pig will be so greedy for blessings and honors that
he will make us overrun the time limit."
"The master's a Buddha now," Pig replied with a smile, "and I want to become one too. So why should I want
to be greedy? Cheeky great fools! Wait here while we hand the scriptures over, then we'll come back to return
with you." The idiot then shouldered a pole while Friar Sand held the horse and Brother Monkey led the holy
monk as they brought their cloud down to land beside the Watching For the Scriptures Tower.
When Taizong and his officials all saw this they came down to greet the travelers with the words, "You are
back, Imperial Younger Brother."
The Tang Priest fell to the ground in a kowtow, only to be helped back to his feet by Taizong, who asked,
"Who are these three?"
"They are disciples I took on along the way," Sanzang replied. Taizong was delighted.
"Harness the horses to our imperial carriage," he ordered his aides, "and invite the Imperial Younger Brother
to mount his steed and return to the palace with us." The Tang Priest thanked him and mounted his horse. The
Great Sage followed closely behind, whirling his golden cudgel. Pig and Friar Sand led the horse and
shouldered the pole as they followed the emperor back to Chang'an. Indeed:
In that year of peace and rising prosperity
Civil and military officials are calm and magnificent.
At a land and water mass the clergy displayed the dharma;
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1393
The monarch commands his ministers in the throne hall of the palace.
A passport was given to Tang Sanzang;
The primal cause of the scriptures has been matched to the Five
Elements.
Through painful tempering all monsters have been destroyed;
Now he returns in triumph to the capital.
The Tang Priest and his three disciples followed the imperial carriage back to the palace. Everybody in the
capital knew that the pilgrim who had gone to fetch the scriptures had now returned.
When the monks, young and old, of the Hongfu Monastery in Chang'an where the Tang Priest used to live
saw that the tops of a number of pine trees were all leaning towards the East they exclaimed in astonishment,
"Odd, very odd! There's been no wind today, so why are the tops of these trees all bent?"
"Fetch our vestments at once," said one of them who was a former disciple of Sanzang. "The master who went
to fetch the scriptures is back."
"How do you know?" the other monks all asked.
"When the master left many years ago," the former disciple replied, "he said that when the branches and tops
of the pines turned East three, four, six or seven years after he had gone he would be back. My master speaks
with the holy voice of a Buddha: that is how I know." They quickly put on their habits and went out.
By the time they reached the Western street, messengers had arrived to say, "The pilgrim who went for the
scriptures has just returned, and His Majesty is bringing him into the city." As soon as they heard this the
monks all hurried over to meet him. When they saw the imperial carriage they dared not come close, but
followed it to the palace gates, where the Tang Priest dismounted and went inside with his disciples.
The Tang Priest stood at the foot of the steps to the throne hall with the dragon horse, the load of sutras,
Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand. Emperor Taizong then summoned the Younger Brother to enter the throne hall
and invited him to sit down, which the Tang Priest did with thanks. He then had the scriptures carried up.
Monkey and the others unpacked the scrolls, which the officials in personal attendance handed to the emperor.
"How many scriptures are there?" the emperor asked. "And how did you fetch them?"
"When your clerical subject reached Vulture Peak and saw the Lord Buddha," Sanzang replied, "he told the
arhats Ananda and Kasyapa to take us first to a precious tower where we were given meatless food, then to the
library, where we were handed the scriptures. The arhats demanded presents, but as we had not brought any
we had none to give. Then they gave us the scriptures. When we had thanked the Buddha for his goodness and
were travelling East the scriptures were snatched away by a demonic gale. Luckily my disciples were able to
recover them by using magic powers, but they had been blown all over the place. On opening them out to look
at them we found that they were all blank, wordless versions. We were so shocked that we went back to report
to the Buddha and plead for the real ones. What the Lord Buddha said was, 'When these scriptures were
composed, bhiksus and holy monks went down the mountain and recited them to the family of the elder Zhao
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1394
in the land of Sravasti. This ensured peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of
the family. All that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of granular gold. I thought that they sold
the scriptures too cheap, so I saw to it that Zhao's sons and grandsons would be poor.' When we realized that
the two arhats were demanding a present and that the Lord Buddha knew all about it we had no choice but to
give them our begging bowl of purple gold. Only then did they hand over the true scriptures with words.
There are thirty−five of them, and a number of rolls from each of them was selected to be given us, making a
total of rolls. This corresponds to the number of rolls in a single Store."
At this Taizong was more delighted than ever. "Let the Protocol Office arrange a thanksgiving banquet in the
Eastern hall," he ordered, at which he suddenly saw the three disciples standing at the foot of the steps,
looking very strange indeed. "Are your distinguished disciples foreigners?" he asked.
"My senior disciple's surname is Sun," the venerable elder replied with a bow, "his Buddhist name is Wukong,
and I also call him Sun the Novice. He originally came from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of
Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Divine Body. For making great havoc in
the palaces of heaven five hundred years ago he was crashed by the Lord Buddha in a stone cell in the Double
Boundary Mountain on the Western frontier. After the Bodhisattva Guanyin persuaded him to mend his ways
he accepted conversion, so when I arrived there I delivered him. I am greatly indebted to him for my
protection. My second disciple Zhu has the Buddhist name Wuneng, and I also call him Pig. He came from
the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mountain of Blessing, and was a monster in Gao Village in the land of Stubet
until he was converted by the Bodhisattva and subdued by Wukong. He has made great efforts, carrying the
load all along the way, and been very useful in crossing rivers. My third disciple's surname is Sha and his
Buddhist name Wujing. He used to be a monster in the Rowing Sands River. He too was converted by the
Bodhisattva and now believes in the Buddhist faith. The horse is not the one that my sovereign gave me."
"How is that?" Taizong asked. "Its markings are the same."
"When your subject was going to cross the waters of the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge by Coiled Snake Mountain my
original horse was devoured by this one," Sanzang replied. "Sun the Novice obliged me by having the
Bodhisattva asked about the horse's background. It was originally the son of the Dragon King of the Western
Sea who had been sent there because of an offence. He too, was saved by the Bodhisattva, who told him to
work for me and turned him into a horse with the same markings as the original one. He has been very helpful
in climbing mountains, crossing ridges, fording rivers and negotiating difficult country. On the outward
journey I rode him, and he carried the scriptures on the way back: I have depended greatly on his efforts."
Taizong was full of boundless praise on learning this. "How long in fact was your journey to the far West?" he
asked.
"I remember the Bodhisattva saying that it was 36,000 miles," Sanzang replied, "but I kept no record of the
distances along the way. All I know is that we experienced fourteen winters and summers. Every day there
was a mountain or a ridge. The woods were big and the rivers wide. I also met several kings who inspected
and stamped my passport. Disciples," he ordered, "fetch the passport and hand it to His Majesty."
When Taizong examined it he saw that it had been issued on the twelfth day of the ninth month of the
thirteenth year of Zhen Guan. "You did indeed make a long and protracted journey," he observed with a touch
of a smile. "It is now the twenty−seventh year of Zhen Guan." On the passport were the seals of the monarchs
of Elephantia, Wuji, Tarrycart, the Womanland of Western Liang, Jisai, Purpuria, Leonia, Bhiksuland and
Dharmadestructia; as well as the seals of the chief officials of Fengxian, Yuhua and Jinping. When Taizong
had read through the passport he put it away.
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1395
Soon the officials in personal attendance on the emperor came to invite them to go to the banquet, whereupon
Taizong led Sanzang by the hand out of the throne hall, asking, "Do your distinguished disciples know how to
behave themselves?"
"My disciples were all demons from mountain villages and from the wilderness," Sanzang replied, "so they do
not understand the etiquette of the sacred court of China. I beg you to forgive them for any offences, Your
Majesty."
"We won't blame them," Taizong said with a smile, "we won't blame them. They are all invited to come with
us to the banquet in the Eastern pavilion." Thanking him once again, Sanzang called his three disciples, and
they all went to the Eastern pavilion to look. This was indeed the great land of China, no ordinary place. Just
look;
Coloured silks hung from the gates,
Red carpets were spread on the floor.
Heavy, rare fragrances,
Fresh and exotic foods.
Amber cups,
Glazed dishes,
Set with gold and nephrite;
Plates of yellow gold,
White jade bowls,
Inlaid with patterns.
Tender braised turnips,
Sugar−dredged taros,
Wonderful sweet mushrooms,
Fine fresh seaweed,
Several servings of bamboo shoots with ginger,
A number of rounds of mallows with honey,
Wheat gluten with leaves of the tree of heaven,
Tree fungus and thin strips of beancurd,
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1396
Agar and aster,
Noodles with ferns and dried rose−petals,
Peppers stewed with radish,
Melon shredded with mustard.
The dishes of vegetables were fine enough,
But the rare and wonderful fruit was outstanding:
Walnuts and persimmon cakes,
Longans and lichees,
Chestnuts from Xuanzhou and Shandong jujubes,
Gingko fruit from South of the Yangtse and hare−head pears,
Hazelnuts, pine nuts and lotus seeds, all big as grapes,
Torreya nuts and melon seeds the size of water chestnuts,
Olives and wild apples,
Pippins and crabs,
Lotus root and arrowhead,
Crisp plums and red baybfenies.
Nothing was missing,
All was complete.
There were steamed honey pastries and other confections,
Best wines and fragrant tea and things out of the ordinary.
Words could not describe the countless delicacies:
The great land of China was not Western barbary.
The master and his three disciples, together with the civil and military officials, stood to left and right as
Emperor Taizong took his seat in the middle. There was singing, dancing and instrumental music, and all was
ordered and solemn as the celebration lasted for the rest of the day. Indeed:
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1397
The monarch's banquet was finer than those of ancient Tang and Yu;
Great was the blessing of the true scriptures obtained.
This was a story to be told with glory for ever:
The light of the Buddha shines throughout the imperial capital.
That evening they thanked the emperor for his kindness, after which Taizong returned to the living quarters of
the palace and the officials went home. The Tang Priest went back with his followers to the Hongfu
Monastery, where the monks welcomed his with kowtows.
No sooner had he gone in through the gates than the monks reported, "Master, these tree−tops all suddenly
leaned East this morning. As we remembered what you had said we went out of the city to meet you, and you
had indeed come." Overcome with delight, the venerable elder then entered the abbot's lodgings. This time
Pig neither shouted for tea and food nor made a row. Brother Monkey and Friar Sand also both behaved well.
As the achievement was now complete they were naturally peaceful. At nightfall they went to bed.
Early the next morning Taizong announced to his officials at his dawn audience, "When we thought of the
most profound and great achievement of our Younger Brother that we have no way of rewarding we were
unable to sleep all night. We managed to draft a few colloquial sentences with which to express our thanks,
but could not write them out. Officials of the Secretariat," he ordered, "write them all down while we recite
them to you." This is the text he dictated:
It is known that Heaven and Earth have their forms as a demonstration of how they provide the cover and
support in which life is contained, whereas the four seasons are invisible, hiding the cold and heat with which
they transform all creatures. Thus it is that by examining Heaven and looking at the Earth even the stupid can
know about their origins, but few are the wise who can exhaust the numbers of the Negative and the Positive.
Heaven and Earth, which are enveloped by the Negative and Positive, are easily understood because of their
images, but the Negative and Positive are hard to fathom because they are formless. If images are clear and
can be grasped even the stupid will not be confused; if forms are hidden and invisible even the wise will be at
a loss.
The way of the Buddha honors emptiness, rides on the mystery and controls silence, yet saves all beings and
dominates all regions. When it raises up the numinous there is nothing higher; when it represses its own
divine strength there is nothing lower. When it is big it extends throughout the cosmos; when tiny it can be
contained in a fraction of an inch. It does not die and it is not born; it endures a thousand aeons and is eternal.
Half hidden and half manifest, it controls all blessings and makes them exist for ever. Mysterious is the
wonderful Way; none of those who follow it know its limits. Silent is the flow of the Dharma: of those who
grasp it none finds its source. So how can mortal fools in their stupidity follow it without doubts or delusion?
The great teaching arose in the West. Later a wondrous dream came to the Han court, spreading its brilliance
and charity to the East. In ancient times, when the Buddha's forms and traces were shared around, they
converted people before word could be spread abroad. In the age when they were sometimes visible and
sometimes invisible, the people looked up to them and followed them. But later the image was obscures and
nirvana was reached, it moved away and left the world, the golden countenance was hidden away and no
longer radiated its brilliance in the three thousand worlds. Pictures of the lovely image were made, vainly
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1398
trying to show the Buddha's thirty−two holy marks. Thereafter his subtle words were widely propagated,
rescuing birds on the three roads of life; the teachings he left behind were spread afar, guiding all living
beings along the ten stages of development. The Buddha has scriptures that can be divided into the Greater
and Lesser Vehicles. There is also magic, the art of spreading mistakes and making right into wrong.
Now our priest Xuanzang, the Master of the Law, is the leader of the Dharma faith. In his youth he was so
careful and perceptive that he soon became aware of the value of the three voids. As he grew up the clarity of
his spirit embraced the four kinds of patience in his conduct. Not even a pine tree in a wind or the moon
reflected in water could be compared with his purity; immortals' dew and bright pearls are no match for his
lustrous splendor. His wisdom encompasses all without encumbrance; his spirit fathoms the formless. Rising
far above the six impurities, he extends his fragrance through a thousand ages. When he concentrated his mind
on the inner sphere he grieved at the torments suffered by the true Dharma; when he settled his thoughts on
the gate of mystery he was distressed by the distortion of the profound writings. He longed to put them back
into order so that the teachings of the past could be propagated again; and to root out apocryphal texts,
enabling the true ones to stay in circulation so as to open the way for later scholars. That is why he lifted up
his heart towards the Pure Land, and made a Dharma journey to the West, braving the dangers of distant lands
as he walked alone, trusting to his staff. When the snow whirled around at dawn the land would disappear in a
moment; and when the dust started to fly at evening the sky was blotted out. He advanced through the mists
across a thousand leagues of mountains and rivers, making his way forward through the frosts and rains of a
hundred changes of season. With great single−mindedness and making light of his efforts he longed deeply to
reach his goal. He wandered around the West for fourteen years, visiting every one of those exotic countries in
his search for the true teaching. He visited the Twin Trees and the Eight Rivers, savoring the Way and braving
the wind. In Deer Park and on Vulture Peak he gazed upon wonders and marvels. He received the good word
from ancient sages and the true teaching from superior worthies, probing deep within the wonderful gates, and
exhausting the mysteries. The Way of the Three Vehicles and the Six Disciplines gallop across the field of his
heart; a hundred cases of texts belonging to one Store roll like waves in the sea of his eloquence. Infinitely
many are the countries he has visited; and vast the number of the scriptures he has collected.
He has obtained 5,048 rolls of all thirty−five of the essential texts of the Great Vehicle to be translated and
made known in China so that the wonderful cause may be promoted. The clouds of mercy he has drawn from
the far West will shed their Dharma rain here in the East. The holy teachings that had been incomplete are
now complete once more; the common folk who had sinned are brought back to blessings. The searing flames
of fire have been damped down, and all have been saved from the ways of delusion; the muddied waves in the
water of wisdom have been made clear once more as all gather on the other bank. From this it can be learned
that the evil fall because of their karma, while the good rise because of their destiny. The origins of these rises
and falls lie in one's own actions. This can be compared with a cassia growing on a high mountain, where only
clouds and dew can nourish its blossom, or a lotus emerging from green waters, its leaves unsullied by flying
dust. It is not that the lotus is pure by nature and the cassia unsullied: they are good because one attaches itself
to what is lofty, where mean and trivial things cannot encumber it, while the other depends on what is clean,
where filth cannot dirty it. Now if plants that know nothing can become good by building themselves up
through goodness, how much the more so should conscientious people achieve blessing through blessed cause
and effect. It is now to be hoped that the true scriptures will be propagated as endlessly as the alternation of
sun and moon; and that this blessing will extend for ever, eternal like heaven and earth.
As soon as this had been written out the holy monk, who was waiting outside the palace gates to express his
thanks, was summoned. The moment he heard the summons, Sanzang hurried and performed the ritual of
kowtows. Taizong then invited him into the throne room and handed him the document, Sanzang read it
through, prostrated himself once more in thanks, and submitted this memorial: "Your Majesty's writing is both
lofty and in the ancient style; it is reasoned, profound and subtle. But I do not know what its title is."
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1399
"What we drafted orally last night," Taizong replied, "We would call a 'Preface to the Holy Teaching'. Would
that be acceptable?" The venerable elder kowtowed and expressed his thanks at great length.
Taizong then said, "Our talent makes us ashamed by comparison with what is recorded on jade tablets; our
words are not worthy of what is inscribed on metal or stone. As for the Inner Scriptures, we are even more
ignorant of them. The text we drafted orally is truly a base and clumsy composition that sullies golden tablets
with brush and ink, and is like placing pebbles in a forest of pearls. When we reflect on it we are filled with
embarrassment. It is most unworthy of merit; we have put you to the trouble of thanking us for nothing."
The officials all expressed their congratulations and kowtowed before the imperial text on the holy teaching,
which was going to be published everywhere in the capital and the provinces.
"Would you be willing to recite some of the true scriptures for us, Younger Brother?" Taizong asked.
"Your Majesty," Sanzang replied, "if true scriptures are to be recited it must be done in the Buddha's ground.
A throne hall is no place for the recital of scriptures."
Taizong was most pleased to accept this. "Which is the purest monastery in the city of Chang'an?" he asked
his officers it attendance, at which the Academician Xiao Yu slipped forward from his rank to memorialize,
"The Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa in the city is the purest of them all."
Taizong then ordered his officials, "Each of you is reverently to bring a few rolls of the true scriptures and
accompany us to the Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa, where we shall invite our younger brother to preach
on the scriptures." The officials, all carrying some rolls of the scriptures, went with Taizong to the monastery,
where a high platform was erected and everything was neatly set out.
"Pig, Friar Sand," the venerable elder commanded, "bring the dragon horse with you and put the luggage in
order. Monkey will stay beside me." He then addressed the emperor, saying, "If Your Majesty wishes to
spread the true scriptures throughout the world copies must be made before they can be published. The
original texts must be stored as great treasures. They may not be shown any disrespect or be defiled."
"Younger Brother," replied Taizong with a smile, "what you say is very correct, very correct." He then
ordered the officials of the Hanlin Academy and the Palace Secretariat to copy out the true scriptures and had
another monastery, the Copying Monastery, founded to the East of the city wall.
The venerable elder mounted the platform with several scriptures in his hands. He was just about to begin
reciting them when scented breezes began to waft around and the Eight Great Vajrapanis appeared in mid−air
to shout aloud, "Scripture−reciter, put those scriptures down and come back to the West with us." Monkey and
the other two, who were standing below Sanzang, all rose up above the ground together with the white horse.
Sanzang put the scriptures down and also rose up to the ninth level of clouds, then went away with them
through the air. Taizong and his officials were all so alarmed that they kowtowed to the sky. This was indeed
a case of
The holy monk long strove to fetch the scriptures;
For fourteen years across the West he strayed.
He journeyed hard and met with much disaster;
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1400
By mountains and by rivers long delayed.
Completing eight times nine and one nine more,
His deeds filled worlds in numbers beyond measure.
He went back to his country taking sutras
That people in the East will always treasure.
When Taizong and all the officials had finished worshipping, eminent monks were selected to prepare a great
Land and Sea Mass in the Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa at which the true scriptures of the Great Store
would be recited, and by which all evil−doing ghosts in the underworld would be saved, and goodness would
spread all around. We will not describe how copies were made of the scriptures and published throughout the
empire.
The story tells instead how the Eight Vajrapanis led the venerable elder, his three disciples and the horse, all
five of them back to Vulture Peak. The journey to Chang'an and back had taken eight days. Just when all the
deities of Vulture Peak were listening to the Buddha preaching, the Eight Vajrapanis led master and disciples
in.
"In obedience to the golden command," they reported to the Tathagata, "your disciples have carried the holy
monks back to the land of Tang, where they handed the scriptures over. We have now come to report our
mission completed." The Tang Priest and his disciples were then told to step forward and be given their jobs.
"Holy Monk," the Tathagata said, "in an earlier life you were my second disciple, and called Master Golden
Cicada. But because you would not listen to my sermon on the Dharma and had no respect for my great
teaching I demoted your soul to be reborn in the East. Now, happily, you have come over to the faith and rely
on our support; and in following our teaching your achievement in fetching the true scriptures has been very
great. Your reward will be to be promoted to high office as the Candana−punya Buddha. Sun Wukong, when
you made great havoc in the palaces of heaven I had to use powerful magic to crush you under the Five
Elements Mountain until, happily, your heaven−sent punishment was completed and you were converted to
the Sakyamuni's faith. It was also fortunate that you suppressed your evil side and gave play to your good side
as you won glory by defeating monsters and demons along the journey. All that was begun has now been
completed and you too will be rewarded with high office as the Victorious Fighting Buddha. Zhu Wuneng;
you used to be a water god in the River of Heaven as Marshal Tian Peng. Because of your drunken flirtation
with an immortal maiden at the Peach Banquet you were sent down to be born in the lower world as a beast.
From your love of the human body you sinned in the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mount of Blessing before
your conversion to the great faith and entry into our Buddhist sect. You guarded the holy monk on his
journey, but your heart is still unregenerate, and you are not yet purged of your lust. But as you won merit by
carrying the luggage you will be rewarded with promotion as the Altar Cleanser."
"They've both been made Buddhas," Pig shouted, "so why am I only the Altar Cleanser?"
"Because you have a voracious appetite, a lazy body and a huge belly," the Tathagata replied. "Now very
many people in the world's four continents believe in our teachings. I will ask you to clean up the altars after
all Buddhist services: your post is of a rank that provides plenty to eat. What is wrong with that?"
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1401
"Sha Wujing, you used to be the Curtain−lifting General until you were banished to the lower world for
smashing a crystal bowl at a Peach Banquet. You fell into the River of Flowing Sands where you sinned by
killing and eating people, until, thank goodness, you were converted to our teaching, sincerely relied on our
support, and won merit by protecting the holy monk and leading the horse up the mountain. Your reward will
be elevation to high office as the Golden Arhat."
Then he said to the white horse. "You were originally the son of Guangjin, the Dragon King of the Western
Ocean. Because you disobeyed your father you were punished for being unfilial until you too were converted
to the Dharma and to our faith. Every day you carried the holy monk to the West, and after that you carried
the holy scriptures back to the East. For these achievements you will be rewarded by being made a Heavenly
Dragon of the Eight Classes of Being."
The venerable elder and his three disciples all kowtowed to express their thanks, and the horse showed its
gratitude too. A protector was then ordered to take the horse straight down to the Dragon−transforming Pool
by the precipice at the back of Vulture Peak and push him into the pool. At once the horse stretched itself out,
shed all its hair, and acquired horns. Golden scales grew all over its body and a silver beard sprouted on its
cheeks and chin. Then, shining all over with auspicious aura and with clouds of good omen in every claw, it
flew up from the Dragon−transforming Pool to coil itself around the Heaven−supporting Winged Column. All
the Buddhas expressed their admiration for the Tathagata's great magic.
"Master," Monkey said to the Tang Priest, "now that I've become a Buddha just like you, surely I don't have to
go on wearing this golden band. Do you plan to say any more Band−tightening Spells to tighten it round my
head? Say a Band−loosening Spell as quickly as you can, take it off, and smash it to smithereens. Don't let
that Bodhisattva or whatever she is make life miserable for anyone else with it."
"It was because you were so uncontrollable in those days that this magic was needed to keep you in order."
Sanzang replied. "Now that you are a Buddha it can of course go. There is no reason for it to stay on your
head any longer. Feel there now." When Monkey raised his hands to feel he found that it had indeed gone.
The Candana−punya Buddha, the Victorious Fighting Buddha, the Altar Cleanser and the Golden Arhat had
all completed the true achievement and reached their proper places. The heavenly dragon horse had also come
back to its true self. There is a poem to prove this that goes:
All of reality turns to dust;
When the four appearances combine the body is renewed.
The substance of the Five Elements is all void;
Forget about the passing fame of fiends.
With Candana−punya comes the great awakening;
When duties are completed they escape from suffering.
Great is the blessing of scriptures spread abroad;
Within the only gate five sages dwell on high.
Journey to the West
Chapter 100 1402
When the five holy ones had taken their places all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, holy monks, arhats, protectors,
bhiksus, lay people, deities and immortals from every cave and every mountain, great gods, Ding and Jia
gods, duty gods, guardians, local deities, and all teachers and immortals who had achieved the Way−−all of
whom had originally come to hear the preaching−−resumed their own places. Just look at it:
The coloured mists surround the Vulture Peak;
Auspicious clouds are massed in the world of bliss.
Golden dragons lie at peace,
Jade tigers all are quiet.
Black hares come and go at will;
Tortoises and snakes coil all around.
Phoenixes red and green are in high spirits;
Happy the dark apes and white deer.
Throughout the year amazing flowers bloom;
Immortal fruit grows in all four seasons.
Lofty pine and ancient juniper,
Blue−green cypress and slender bamboo.
Plums of every color, in blossom or in fruit,
Eternal peaches, sometimes ripe and sometimes new.
A thousand kinds of fruit and flower vie in beauty;
All of the sky is filled with auspicious mists.
They all put their hands together in front of their chests in salutation and recited together:
"Homage to the ancient Dipamkara Buddha.
Homage to Bhaisajya−guru−vaiduryaprabhasa Buddha.
Homage to Sakyamuni Buddha.
Homage to the Buddhas of Past, Present and Future.

Thus it is that all the Buddhas of every world
Are willing with this achievement
To adorn the Pure Land of the Buddha.
Above we can repay the fourfold kindness,
Below we save those suffering in the three paths of life.
Let anyone who sees or hears
Cherish the enlightened mind.
May all be reborn in the Land of Bliss,
To end this present life of retribution.
All the Buddhas of Past, Present and Future in the Ten Regions, all the Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas,
Maha−prajnaparamita."
Here ends the Journey to the West.
